          This sermon will discuss the institutions that make up each part of 
          the Church of God. It will discuss schools, disbursement of 
          ecclesiastical goods and money, and the use or abuse of fame within 
          the Church context. It will discuss how to chastise and correct 
          Ministers of local parishes, and global Church leaders. The sermon 
          will also discuss women in the context of the Church, whether they 
          are virgins, married women, widows, or nuns. The sermon will discuss 
          monks and church leaders. It will also discuss how to treat the sick, 
          how to celebrate a funeral and how to bury a member of the parish. 
          The tenth sermon defines the primitive church and analyzes what 
          current religious practices do and do not belong in the original 
          church established by Jesus Christ, and the original Apostles and 
          Disciples. This sermon discusses the necessity to return to the 
          simplicity established by the structures and practices of the 
          primitive church. 
          <cb ed="#L" n="a"/>
          There are a few certain things that remain true which I will 
          expound to you dearly beloved. 
          These things pertain to the Church, and the preservation of its 
          ministry. 
          There are certain ordinances that the Church established that do 
          not fit(*) in the primitive church. 
          <!-- is B. talking about the Catholic church? says nothing in text. -->
        </p>
        <p xml:id="UD1xh4-7yMcbW-d1e138">
          In the last sermon of this decade, if the Lord gives me the grace to 
          speak, I intend to briefly convey this information.
          God did not burden his church with many laws and institutions, but 
          he did send down(?) a few easily understood and simply numbered laws. 
          These original laws were not costly, confusing, or long. 
          <!-- "send down?" also references? -->
        </p>
        <p xml:id="UD1xh4-7yMcbW-d1e156">
          In the past when the Lord commanded costly and extravagant 
          worship from his people, he did not intend to add or take from the 
          pleasure of men, or to otherwise bleed men other than the way that he 
          appointed. 
        </p>
        <p xml:id="UD1xh4-7yMcbW-d1e178">
          <!--1112.xml-->
          <cb ed="#L" n="b"/>
          Who will think that after abolishing/annulling/rejecting(?) the 
          exorbitant(?) laws (of when?), the Lord would deliver extravagant 
          laws and infinite requirements to the Church of the new people?
          The covetous pastors, the estates of the church, and monstrous 
          common superstition among the people made the church have extravagant 
          laws and institutions. 
          <!-- rephrase former 3 lines -->
          Let us remember that the Lord our God instituted few laws and 
          institutions in his church. These few requirements are necessary. 
          However, we should endeavor that the church is not over-burdened 
          with traditions and institutions that do not come from God himself. 
          The Church of God is lavish in her simplicity if she keeps the few 
          institutions of her God. 
        </p>
        <p xml:id="UD1xh4-7yMcbW-d1e233">
          The principal points of the church’s godliness are the sincere 
          teaching of the laws, the teachings of the prophets, Christ and 
          his apostles, faithful prayer offered to God through Christ, a 
          devout and lawful administration, and recipience of Christ’s 
          sacraments. These principal points are examined throughout the 
          Decades.
          <!-- Change “religious” to “devout” I think administration 
          should change; doesn’t really catch all that I think it means 
          Recipience? Is that even a real word? -->
          
          <!--1113.xml-->
          <!-- 1083 -->
          Charity, the communicating of riches and services is also a principal 
          point of the church’s godliness. We have already discussed 
          charity in the <ref>first decade</ref>, and we will further discuss it in 
          this sermon.
        </p>
        <p xml:id="UD1xh4-7yMcbW-d1e278">
          In the <ref>Acts of the Apostles</ref>, <name>Luke</name> does not mention anything besides the 
          few principals of godliness that we mentioned when describing the 
          faithful primitive Church of Christ. 
          The faithful, primitive Church of Christ was created by the original 
          Apostles and it was upon the foundation of the principal points of 
          godliness. 
          According to <name>Luke</name> in the <ref>Acts of the Apostles</ref>, <quote>“They were continuing 
          in the doctrine of the Apostles, and in communicating, and in 
          breaking of bread and in prayer.” </quote>
          These few points comrpise true godliness. 
          The following institutions and new traditions have joined the 
          ecclesiastical ministry and contribute to the church’s godliness.
          <!-- The previous sentence needs some extra help. Revise. -->
          Christian schools, for example, teach the principal points of godliness, 
          and they bring forth an increase of prophets and ministers of the 
          church. 
          Most first world nations recognize that without schools, nations 
          cannot produce and maintain kingdoms or commonwealths.
          <name>Moses</name> in the <ref>book of Genesis</ref>, and <name>Strabo</name> in his <ref>17th book of 
          Geography</ref> report that the Egyptians established the most famous 
          colleges for priests and philosophers. 
          <name>Samuels</name>’s <ref>Holy Histories</ref> mention that the most noblemen throughout 
          the world traveled to Egypt to obtain wisdom. 
          <name>Plato</name> is said to be the first chief and principal philosopher.
        </p>
        <p xml:id="UD1xh4-7yMcbW-d1e374">
          In the <ref>book of Kings</ref>, it is thoughtfully written that 
          <name>Salomon</name> excelled the wise men of Egypt in wisdom. Not only the 
          Egyptians, but also the Palestinians who were a nation famous for…

          war, but still had wise priests of whom they asked council in times 
          of doubt. 
        </p>
        <p xml:id="UD1xh4-7yMcbW-d1e414">
          In <ref>*where?*</ref>, <name>Daniel</name> witnessed that the Babylonians, the Medes and the 
          Persians also had famous schools. These schools produced Magi, which 
          are known as wise men, who are known in all parts of philosophy. 
          <!-- note: where daniel says this? revise. -->
          I do not need to discuss the Greeks and the Romans since everyone is 
          aware of the famous city of Athens because so many learned men speak 
          of it. 
          Athens was also home to good colleges of priests and soothsayers. 
          <!-- word: soothsayer- revise -->
          Omitting foreign examples, let us examine local ecclesiastical 
          school models.

          God gave his people absolute happiness in the form of a commonwealth, 
          kingdom, and distributed schools throughout 48 towns in Switzerland. 
          The towns called Levites “Levitical” because of their philosophy. 
          He consecrated the Levitical Tribe and made them priests and scholars. 
          It wasn’t unlawful for gentlemen of other Tribes to study philosophy 
          or wisdom, but the Levites were particularly appointed to holy 
          studies. 
          The Levites were particularly appointed for holy studies because the 
          Tribe later produced <name>Clay</name> and <name>Daniel</name>, two of the most intelligent men 
          of the tribe of Juda, thus fulfilling the prophecy.
        </p>
        <p xml:id="UD1xh4-7yMcbW-d1e487">
          Other Tribes have produced a singuluar kind of knowledge. 
          Those towns that specialized in one discipline were called Levitical 
          and priestly, not only because priests lived there, but also because 
          they had synagogues in the town.

          At the tabernacle in Silo, and in the city of Jerusalem, there was a 
          school that surpassed all others that people now call a university. 
        </p>
        <p xml:id="UD1xh4-7yMcbW-d1e538">
          <ref><name>Samuel</name>’s Holy History</ref> notes that famous men had the government of 
          those schools. 
          We read in <ref>Kama</ref> that <name>Samuel</name>, the most intelligent, godly wise man was 
          the governor and principal of Naioth, better known as Burse or the 
          College of Prophets. 
          <name>Helias</name> and <name>Heliseus</name> were the clearest lights of the Church of Israel. 
          Both <name>Helias</name> and <name>Heliseus</name> were rulers over the schools of Hierico 
          and Gilgal respectively. 
          <name>Jeroboam</name> naughtily took down schools and treaded under foot beneath 
          the order of the priests. 
          <name>Jeroboam</name> manipulated people and places that were the refuse of their 
          society. 
        </p>
        <p xml:id="UD1xh4-7yMcbW-d1e600">
          <name>Helias</name> and <name>Heliseus</name>, men of God, knew well that without schools, the 
          doctrine could not flourish or be preserved. 
          Therefore, both men applied themselves to the whole(?) rejuvenation 
          of schools.
          Wicked princes bestowed lawful tributes meant for the schools upon 
          flatterers and bellies, better known as priests of the Tools of 
          calves, and of Baal.
          By the goodness of the Lord, it came to pass that some good men 
          bestowed tributes upon those who were desirous of learning, and who 
          were content with a meager living, and who had valiant behavior during 
          a corrupt age. 
          Notable wise men and prophets who governed the schools were called 
          fathers. The disciples and scholars who attended the schools were 
          called sons of prophets. 
          <name>Amos</name> and <name>Jeremiah</name> called the fathers and the sons “parasites.” 
        </p>
        <p xml:id="UD1xh4-7yMcbW-d1e656">
          <name>Amos</name> said, <quote>“I am no prophet…”

         “neither am I the son of a prophet.”</quote> 
          <name>Amos</name> was not, as far as we know, schooled in a liberal arts 
          curriculum. 
          <name>Amos</name> said again, <quote>“I have raised some of your sons as Prophets, and 
          some of your young men as Nazarites.”</quote>
          <name>Jeremiah</name> commanded that these sons and young men received education 
          from a Christian school. 
          Later on, <name>Jeremiah</name> lamented and wailed in hope of his death during 
          his captivity. 
          Furthermore, the young men are called sons of the prophets because of 
          the affection that they have for their school masters. The young 
          scholars obey their school masters and revere them as if they had 
          been their parents because they are grateful to study daily with 
          them.

          The princes were much more noble and wise. They diligently restored 
          schools, and indirectly, they repaired ecclesiastical order. 
          <name>David</name>, <name>Solomon</name>, <name>Jolaphat</name>, <name>Ezechias</name>, and <name>Josias</name> were the happiest and 
          most virtuous princes because of their dedication to restoring 
          Christian schools. 
          During and after the captivity of Babylon, the Lord’s people scattered 
          into many different kingdoms. But wherever they went, the created 
          schools or synagogues.
          When the city of Jerusalem was restored, the Lord’s people returned 
          and built schools and synagogues. 
          The <ref>Acts of the Apostles</ref> mention that when <name>Saint Paul</name> preached the 
          word of God among the Gentiles, he also went into the synagogues to 
          teach.

          the Lord’s people were dispersed and scattered abroad, but they did 
          sometimes come to the holy city of Jerusalem. 
          The <ref>Acts of the Apostles</ref> says, <quote>“There were dwelling at Jerusalem 
          certain Jews, religious men, of all nations that are under heaven.”</quote> 
          <name>Saint Paul</name> is confirmation of the passage in the <ref>Acts</ref>. He confirms 
          that he was born free in the city of Tharsus and he traveled to 
          Jerusalem to hear instruction at <name>Gamaliel</name>’s feet. <name>Saint Paul</name> wished 
          to be a scholar under <name>Gamaliel</name>. 
          We read in the <ref>Acts</ref> that in Jerusalem, there were colleges or 
          Synagogues established by the Livertines, Cyrenians, Alerandrines, 
          Cilicians, and Asians.

          The use of schools continued until Christ’s time and after his 
          ascension into heaven, almost until the destruction of the city.

          Out of all the things we have discussed, I think that it is unknown to 
          all men that schools do principally intend to preserve the church, 
          and to maintain the holy ministry.
          In schools, art is a potentially profitable discipline because 
          it can further the study of the holy scriptures which are the most 
          important of all studies and knowledge. 
          The knowledge of holy tongues, logic, natural philosophy, and mathematics 
          are moderately known, and can be directed to the certain end of Godliness. 
          Men may find a community of scholars who are diversely educated in various

          You may find some scholars so involved with the study of mathematics that 
          they would more likely become engineers or construction workers rather than 
          Church leaders. 
          These men are so concerned with the study of Astronomy, and 
          “the Astronomer’s Heaven” that they forget the blessed heaven, 
          which is the seat** of the saints. 
          Heaven holds all that anyone needs to be sufficiently happy, however 
          some astronomers believe that the knowledge of the motion of the visible 
          heaven, and the course of the stars is happiness enough. 
          Those that meddle too much with philosophy, the trifles of logic, and the 
          rules of rhetoric never attain any end, nor do they ever think to donate 
          to the edification of the church. 
          Often, these types of men become preoccupied with academic debate. 
          They often become contentious, arrogant, and controlling. These types of 
          scholars do not seem to be content with how others speak or act. 
          Certain scholars are not content with the traditional status of beliefs

          The Lord judges that it is necessary to minister to the preachers’ needs.
          As long as preachers do no unworthy deed with their wages, they should 
          be able to provide for themselves and their families. 
          Jesus compared preachers not to idle men who eat freely of other men’s 
          bread, nor to beggars, but to laborers. 
          As our Lord sets down in law, it is a great offense to deny laborers their 
          hire. 
          “Even so their offense is not small ye suffer such as are faithful

          “You have freely received, therefore give it freely.”
          Jesus spoke of the gift of working miracles and the benefit of health 
          for the sick, diseased, and oppressed. It is written, “Heal the sick, 
          cleanse the leprous, raise the dead, cast out devils.”
          He added to those words when he said, “You have received it [wages?] 
          freely, therefore bestow it freely.” 
          Though the Apostles received rewards from the people to whom they preached, 
          no man read that they took anything for the gift of healing that they 
          had received in the Lord’s name.

          Like as Heliseus wouldn’t take anything at all even though it was freely 
          offered by Naaman the Syrian captain who Heliseius cured of leprosy. 
          The same Heliseus did not refuse the gift of the man that came to him 
          from Baalsalisa. From the same Gospel of Christ our Lord, ministers 
          have to learn how to use their wages from the church. 
          The Lord commanded Judas to depart after seeing what was in his purse 
          [silver coins]. The disciples thought that he had been commanded to 
          go and buy necessities that would serve for the holy day or for the poor. 
          It is clear that the Lord used the stipend that he received to provide 
          necessities for himself and his family, and also to give alms thereof. 
          In sum, make note that the ministers of the church should provide 
          necessary things for their living, function and the maintenance of 
          their household from the wages they receive from the church. 
          Again, they may also use the same wages to give alms to the poor because 
          the wages were earned truthfully by the ministers. 
          The Lord said clearly in the law that the tithes…

          Oblations or holy revenues like from the Levites are all acceptable to 
          him because they sacrificed anything that they could offer from their 
          own chest(?), store or possessions. 
          If a laborer offers to God anything of his hire or wages, meaning if he 
          gives to the poor, doesn’t it seem like an acceptable sacrifice to God?
          Therefore, it is very acceptable that the minister bestows alms from the 
          wages of the holy ministry. 
          Another example is about a laborer who is building a church. This laborer 
          receives wages from the church. Should a man say that the laborer took 
          alms and his alms should not be given out to others? No because he 
          received wages for his work because he did labor. Therefore, he gives 
          alms of his own wages, and of his own lawful and proper goods. 
          Therefore, it is clear that the minister of the church does not 
          live by alms. He should not give alms from alms he received, but he 
          did labor for his wages and therefore he received the reward of his work 
          as a laborer does. The Lord himself compared the minister to the 
          laborer, so it is right that a minister should earn wages as a laborer 
          does. 
          If any man is too dishonest to listen to me, he will not hear what I say. 
          Instead, he should hear what Paul the Apostle says. 
          “If we sow spiritual things, is it a great matter if we mow your carnal 
          things?” And again, 
          “The elders that govern well are worthy of double honor, especially 
          those that travel in preaching and teaching.”
          The Scripture says, “You shall not muzzle the mouth of the oxe treading 
          through the corn.” And, 
          “The laborer is worthy of his hire.”
          Therefore, the Apostle does not think that inestimable goodness 
          of the ministry can by any means be recompensed with a vile thing, 
          meaning earthly wages.
          Again, Paul says, “They that labor, not they that loiter in teaching”
          <!--1120.xml-->
          <pb ed="#L" n="1120"/>

          Paul compares these men that labor to an ore that is a toiling beast, 
          and a thresher(?) out of corn, and also to a laboring man. (?)
          I do warn you that because in our wicked and thankless world, certain 
          men—monsters—most unthankful that believe that ministers do nothing at 
          all, even the most faithful that do their duty. These monsters cry out 
          and claim that ministers eat as beggars, and that it cost them nothing. 
          By name and infamy these monsters are terrifying because they forsake 
          the study of good learning and divinity. They abhor the ministry, as 
          though it is beggarly and dishonest. 
          In such groups of men, the devil grows his kingdom through abuse, 
          appropriately using to his benefit our ingratitude and malice. 
          Why do these men not suffer themselves to be among Christ and the Holy 
          Apostles, who were fed and maintained by the churches stipend, then to 
          be judged as thankless and proud people that scrape and gather all 
          their goods together by usury and wicked means. 
          Or at least if they had not gotten their goods by sinister means, they 
          probably received them through liberality and the goodness of God, for 
          which they never sweat or worked for.

          Saint Paul proved many arguments that ministers have a right to 
          receive a stipend for the holy ministry. He said,
          “Have we not power and authority to eat and drink, or may we not bring 
          with us a woman or sister?”
          For Paul meant the lawfulness and authority to receive anything 
          necessary for himself, his wife and his whole household. And for that…

          He asked a question, he showed what he meant, and therefore he declared 
          a plain truth of equity among all men. He added examples, not of every 
          man personally, but of all generally, especially the Apostles of Christ 
          and those that were kin of Christ by blood saying: 
          “Even as the other Apostles and brothers of our Lord and Cephas?”
          And who is Cephas, but Peter? To this, Cephas the Lord said in the first 
          chapter out of Saint John, “You shall be called Cephas, which if a man 
          interprets it, means a stone. But Peter was surnamed of a rock to the 
          intent the interpretation of the name may always be the same.”

          Who, I pray to you, are the Lords brethren but John and James, and James the brother of Judas, and Judas and Simon the brethren of James. 
          “All these,” said Saint Paul, “lived off the stipend they had, that was gathered from the common assembly of the Church.”
          Besides these examples, Paul added others like them that are commonly put into practice. 
          He said, “Who goes to war at his own cost and charges? Who plants a vineyard and doesn’t eat of the fruit from it? Who feeds a flock and does not drink their milk?”
          Paul brings forth these similitudes and properly applies them. The ministers of the church are sometimes called soldiers or vineyard keepers, or husbandmen or shepherds. 
          Who, I pray, is so far from reason that he would deny meat and clothing to soldiers, husbandmen and shepherds? They take pains in warfare, husbandry, and with cattle.

          The true hearted men are indifferent. They acknowledge that the ministers 
          of the Church may live by the ecclesiastical ministry. 
          Very few men object that these humane parables and similitudes taken from 
          common use prove nothing in an ecclesiastical cause.
          He added, “Do I speak these things according to man? Doesn’t the law say 
          the same? It is written in the law of Moses, you shall not muzzle the 
          ox that treads out the corn.” 
          ***“As though he should say, I have in a readiness for the confirmation 
          of our right, not only human similitudes but also testimonies of the 
          holy scripture” 
          As Paul would say, I have readily confirmed our [ministers’] right to 
          wages, not only through human comparisons, but also by citing testimonies 
          in the holy scriptures.
          Saint Paul, in chapter 2 of Deuteronomy discusses how to nourish laboring 
          oxen. If any man says that the other passages should not be used in 
          comparison to preachers but only referring to oxen, he should then look 
          at this passage.
          Paul says, “Does God care for oxen? Or does he not speak altogether for 
          our sake? It is doubtless that God has written it for our sake, that he 
          who plows can plow in hope, and that he who harvests (thresheth?) in 
          hope may be the partaker of his hope.”
          The Lord said in his law that he would provide for us. For he equally 
          gathered, by a certain syllogism or argument his proofs for the debate. 
          If the lord provided for beasts and cattle, and considered them, 
          how much more for men would he provide? It is an unjust thing that a 
          husbandman could labor without his ox and without hope, meaning in vain, 
          and without commodity. 
          Therefore, since it is an unjust thing, for the minister to exercise 
          ecclesiastical harvesting (husbandry?)….

          Moreover, the Apostle rejects the possibility that the spiritual ministry does not 
          receive any corporal reward and is only allowed to reap spiritual rewards. He 
          answered, “If we sow unto you spiritual things, is it important that we reap your 
          temporal things?”
          The Apostle thinks that the Corinthians gave nothing when they gave temporal things 
          when these temporal goods are compared with eternal good things, which the ministers 
          provide in their teachings. 
          Look at how far the soul excels the body. One can accomplish much more with spiritual 
          goods rather than temporal goods. 
=          The Apostle concealed an argument in his discussion where he admonished that farmers 
who sow should also reap. 
          In this issue there are great inequalities because the ministers sow better spiritual 
          rewards, but do not receive nearly as much payment as other laborers. 
          Some men think that ministers do not do anything, however this is untrue because they 
          set light by God and represent/carry forth the divine ministry. 
          Saint Paul confirmed his own right through an example with others when he said, “If 
          other people partake in the power towards you, why should we not?” 
          Seeing nothing took more pains among the Corinthians than Saint Paul. No man was more 
          worthy of reward compared to the ministers. 
          Saint Paul confirmed his right to a wage by example of the Lord’s commandment and 
          ordinance that said: “You do not know what pains the ministers take in holy things, 
          what they do eat of the holy things and that they the ministers of the altar are 
          partakers of the altar? So far as the Lord ordained, that those people who preach the 
          Gospel should live off the Gospel. 
          Where does the Lord ordain this? He ordains this in the Gospel when he says, “the 
          laborer is worthy of his hire.” 
          I judge this…

          ****to be observed while the Apostle spoke in plain words, that the Lord instituted 
          his ordinance concerning the maintenance of the ministers of the Church in order to 
          \imitate the laws of the ancient Jewish peoples. 
          Here we should understand that in cases like this, we should not reject the ancient

          Saint Paul the Apostle did not use his authority as he could have, but this means 
          nothing regarding these things because these practices are questions of deed and of 
          what is right. 
          Indeed he took nothing of the Corinthians for difference causes, but he did take 
          from other churches. He did not receive anything from the Church of Thessalonica. 
          All that he did is not prejudicial to the equity of the right of each church. 
          Saint Paul said to the Corinthians, “I have robbed other churches because I have 
          received wages from them, however, I did this with the intent that I might do you 
          service. When I was with you and I was wanted, I was not burdensome to any man. The 
          things that I lacked were given to me by brethren from Macedonia.” 
          To the Thessalonians he said, “We haven’t behaved like ourselves inordinately among 
          you, neither did we take bread for nothing. With labor and pain both night and day, 
          doing our work, we intended that we would not be a burden to any of you. Not that it 
          is lawful for us to do that, but because we set ourselves down as role models/a 
          pattern for you to follow, we do deserve bread.” 
          Saint Paul then said to the Thessalonians, “I ask that you acknowledge the people who 
          labor among you and who are over you in the Lord, who admonish you…”

          “So that you take them in singular love through love for their work’s sake. Be at 
          peace with them” 
          Let as much as is necessary be given to Church ministers and teachers so far as 
          what is given is honest and necessary. 
          Thus, this is what is spoken about the due proportion that is to be paid to pastors.

          In the past, the second part of ecclesiastical goods were allotted to clerks. 
          Clerks are the harvest of pastors, studiers of divinity, and are completely disposed 
          to the holy ministry. 
          As long as these clerks have dedicated themselves and all that they have completely 
          to the Church and the ministry, it is fit that they should be nourished and 
          maintained by the costs of the Church. 
          It is convenient that they are nourished meanly because they should be an example 
          of people who live inexpensively.

          To be brought up delicately/richly/wealthily does not agree with the ministries of the

          We spoke of this matter in another place.

          The third part of ecclesiastical goods are appointed for the poor. There are 
          different types of poor people; widows, pupils, orphans and infants who are cast 
          out and who’s parents are unknown. Some of the poor people are worn with old age and 
          spent with diseases. 
          There are infinite kinds of diseases, but the most grievous are these that follow:

          There are some poor men with land, and there are also some strangers that are 
          banished from their country and home for the sake of righteousness, and because of 
          the word of God. 
          There are some people who have yet to overcome extreme poverty and are in grave 
          danger of falling into it. 
          If these people are not helped with ready money, they will come to be kept by the 
          church box.

          Of all the people’s health that the Lord protects, the Lord tells us to be mindful. 
          He says, “Whatever we bestow upon the poor, we bestow upon Him (the Lord).” 
          If we despise and do not regard the poor, without a doubt we despise and neglect our 
          Lord God himself.
          Out of duty, we should help the poor out of our own good will through offering 
          counsel, comfort, medicines, cures, money, meat, drink, clothes, lodging and 
          assistance by any means else that we can manage in all such matters and cases if they

          The Church’s goodness is not sufficient to give ample aid to the poor in full. Let 
          the abundance of good faithful people supply their want. However, if there is a 
          sufficient amount of goods laid up in storage, let these goods contribute to the 
          liberality of the godly. This is often taken away by governors through negligence or 
          wickedness and it causes the necessity of the poor to be ignored and unfulfilled. In
