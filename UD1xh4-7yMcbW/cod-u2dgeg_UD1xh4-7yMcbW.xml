          <lb ed="#L" n="11"/>There remaine certaine 
          <lb ed="#L" n="12"/>things but a few true 
          <lb ed="#L" n="13"/>ly, which are to bee ex 
          <lb ed="#L" n="14"/>pounded unto you (deere 
          <lb ed="#L" n="15"/>ly beloved) the which 
          <lb ed="#L" n="16"/>partely appertayne to the instituti 
          <lb ed="#L" n="17"/>on of the Ecclesiasticall ministerie 
          <lb ed="#L" n="18"/>and preservation thereof, there are 
          <lb ed="#L" n="19"/>partelie certaine percular ordinaun 
          <lb ed="#L" n="20"/>ces of the Church which the Church  
          <lb ed="#L" n="21"/>can not want. Whereof in this last 
          <lb ed="#L" n="22"/>Sermon of this Decade, so farre 
          <lb ed="#L" n="23"/>as the Lorde shall give mee grace to 
          <lb ed="#L" n="24"/>speake, I intende as briefly as I can 
          <lb ed="#L" n="25"/>to intreate. 
          <lb ed="#L" n="26"/>First of all we must know that the 
          <lb ed="#L" n="27"/>Lorde our God hath not burdened his 
          <lb ed="#L" n="28"/>church with over manie lawes &amp; in 
          <lb ed="#L" n="29"/>stitutions, but hath let downe a fewe 
          <lb ed="#L" n="30"/>easily to be numbered, &amp; those not costly,  
          <lb ed="#L" n="31"/>nor intricate, nor long, but profitable, 
          <lb ed="#L" n="32"/>simple, plaine and short. 
          <lb ed="#L" n="33"/>In time past, when as under the law 
          <lb ed="#L" n="34"/>the Lord appointed unto the people a 
          <lb ed="#L" n="35"/>costly and sumptuous worshipping of  
          <lb ed="#L" n="36"/>him, not withstanding al things there 
          <lb ed="#L" n="37"/>in were certaine, numerable, and mo 
          <lb ed="#L" n="38"/>derate: neyther woulde he have anie 
          <lb ed="#L" n="39"/>thing added to, or taken from it at the 
          <lb ed="#L" n="40"/>pleasure of men, or to bee otherwise b 
          <lb ed="#L" n="41"/>led than he had appointed.

          <lb ed="#L" n="42"/>Who then will thinke, that after 
          <lb ed="#L" n="43"/>the abrogating of the Lawe, the Lord 
          <lb ed="#L" n="44"/>would deliver unto the Church of his 
          <lb ed="#L" n="45"/>new people, a sumptuous and an infi 
          <lb ed="#L" n="46"/>nite discipline? Wherefore it is partly 
          <lb ed="#L" n="47"/>the couetousnesse of the Pastours and  
          <lb ed="#L" n="48"/>estates of the Church, and partly the 
          <lb ed="#L" n="49"/>monstrous superstition of the common 
          <lb ed="#L" n="50"/>people, that hath made everie thing for 
          <lb ed="#L" n="51"/>sumptuous, and infinite in the church. 
          <lb ed="#L" n="52"/>Let us sticke unto this, that the Lord 
          <lb ed="#L" n="53"/>our GOD hath instituted in his 
          <lb ed="#L" n="54"/>Church, but verie fewe thinges, and 
          <lb ed="#L" n="55"/>such as are necessarie: and therefore 
          <lb ed="#L" n="56"/>we ought all to indeavour, that the 
          <lb ed="#L" n="57"/>church be not over-burdened with tra 
          <lb ed="#L" n="58"/>ditions and institutions, which procee 
          <lb ed="#L" n="59"/>ded not from GOD himselfe. The 
          <lb ed="#L" n="60"/>Church of God is gorgeously enough 
          <lb ed="#L" n="61"/>decked and furnished, if she retaine and 
          <lb ed="#L" n="62"/>keep the institutions of her God and 
          <lb ed="#L" n="63"/>Lorde. 
          <lb ed="#L" n="64"/>The chiefe and principall poyntes 
          <lb ed="#L" n="65"/>of the Godlinesse of the Church of  
          <lb ed="#L" n="66"/>GOD, are the sincere teaching of  
          <lb ed="#L" n="67"/>the lawe and the Prophetes, of Christ 
          <lb ed="#L" n="68"/>and the Apostles, faithfull Prayer of

          <lb ed="#L" n="1"/>hitherto through the Decades. Here 
          <lb ed="#L" n="2"/>unto belongeth Charitie also, which 
          <lb ed="#L" n="3"/>is a communicating of riches, or well 
          <lb ed="#L" n="4"/>doing, whereof wee have saide some 
          <lb ed="#L" n="5"/>what alreadie in the first Decade, and 
          <lb ed="#L" n="6"/>will have somewhat else in this Ser 
          <lb ed="#L" n="7"/>mon. 
          <lb ed="#L" n="8"/>Neyther doeth Luke in the Actes 
          <lb ed="#L" n="9"/>make mention of any other things, de 
          <lb ed="#L" n="10"/>scribing what manner of Church the 
          <lb ed="#L" n="11"/>faithfull primitive Church of Christe 
          <lb ed="#L" n="12"/>was, being founded by the Apostles, &amp; 
          <lb ed="#L" n="13"/>what were the principal points thereof. 
          <lb ed="#L" n="14"/>They were continuing, sayeth he, in 
          <lb ed="#L" n="15"/>the doctrine of the Apostles, and in 
          <lb ed="#L" n="16"/>communicating, and in breaking of 
          <lb ed="#L" n="17"/>bread and in prayer. Under these few 
          <lb ed="#L" n="18"/>points all godlinesse is comprised. Un 
          <lb ed="#L" n="19"/>to the Ecclesiastical ministery are joy 
          <lb ed="#L" n="20"/>ned these that folow. Christian schooles 
          <lb ed="#L" n="21"/>have the first place, which being foorth 
          <lb ed="#L" n="22"/>a plentifull increase of Prophetes or 
          <lb ed="#L" n="23"/>Ministers of the Church. All nations 
          <lb ed="#L" n="24"/>unles they were altogether barbarous 
          <lb ed="#L" n="25"/>have understoode that without schooles 
          <lb ed="#L" n="26"/>no kingdomes or common weales can 
          <lb ed="#L" n="27"/>happily be maintained. And therefore 
          <lb ed="#L" n="28"/>not onely Moses in the book of Ge 
          <lb ed="#L" n="29"/>nesis, but also Strabo in the 17. booke 
          <lb ed="#L" n="30"/>of his Geographie, reporteth how that 
          <lb ed="#L" n="31"/>among the Egyptians were instituted 
          <lb ed="#L" n="32"/>most famous Colledges for Priestes &amp; 
          <lb ed="#L" n="33"/>Philosophers. Histories also make 
          <lb ed="#L" n="34"/>mention, that the most noble men of al 
          <lb ed="#L" n="35"/>the worlde, travayled into Egypt to 
          <lb ed="#L" n="36"/>obtaine wisedome, in which number 
          <lb ed="#L" n="37"/>Plato also is saide to be the first of the 
          <lb ed="#L" n="38"/>chiefe and principall among the Phil 
          <lb ed="#L" n="39"/>losophers. 
          <lb ed="#L" n="40"/>Neither is it unadvisedly written 
          <lb ed="#L" n="41"/>in the booke of the Kinges, that Salo 
          <lb ed="#L" n="42"/>mon excelled the wise men of the E 
          <lb ed="#L" n="43"/>gyptians in wisedome. And not onely

          <lb ed="#L" n="47"/>to have had their Priests, of whom  
          <lb ed="#L" n="48"/>they asked cousell in matters of doubt,  
          <lb ed="#L" n="49"/>as writeth Samuel in his holie Hi 
          <lb ed="#L" n="50"/>storie. 
          <lb ed="#L" n="51"/>And Daniel also witnesseth, that  
          <lb ed="#L" n="52"/>the Babylonians had moste famous  
          <lb ed="#L" n="53"/>Schooles, as also had the Medes and  
          <lb ed="#L" n="54"/>Persians, from whence sprang foorth 
          <lb ed="#L" n="55"/>their Magi, I would saye wise men,  
          <lb ed="#L" n="56"/>notable in all parties of Philosophie.  
          <lb ed="#L" n="57"/>I neede not to speake any thing of the 
          <lb ed="#L" n="58"/>Greekes and Romanes, since there 
          <lb ed="#L" n="59"/>is no man but knoweth their most fa 
          <lb ed="#L" n="60"/>mous Citie of Athens, which is so 
          <lb ed="#L" n="61"/>much spoken of by all learned men. 
          <lb ed="#L" n="62"/>and also the goodly Colledges of their  
          <lb ed="#L" n="63"/>Priests and Southsayers. But o 
          <lb ed="#L" n="64"/>mitting foreine examples, let us al 
          <lb ed="#L" n="65"/>ledge our owne or such as are Ecclesi 
          <lb ed="#L" n="66"/>asticall. 
          <lb ed="#L" n="67"/>God, who gave unto his people, a 
          <lb ed="#L" n="68"/>moste absolute fourme of an happie  
          <lb ed="#L" n="69"/>Common weale and kingdome, distri 
          <lb ed="#L" n="70"/>buted schooles through fortie and eight  
          <lb ed="#L" n="71"/>townes of the realme. Those townes  
          <lb ed="#L" n="72"/>by reason of the Philosophy Levits,  
          <lb ed="#L" n="73"/>were called Leviticall. For hee had 
          <lb ed="#L" n="74"/>consecrated all the Leviticall Tribe,  
          <lb ed="#L" n="75"/>unto the Priesthood and to studies: 
          <lb ed="#L" n="76"/>not for that it was not also lawful for  
          <lb ed="#L" n="77"/>Gentlemen of other Tribes to studie 
          <lb ed="#L" n="78"/>Philosophie or wisedome: but because  
          <lb ed="#L" n="79"/>the Levites were peculiarlie appoin 
          <lb ed="#L" n="80"/>ted unto holy studies.  
          <lb ed="#L" n="81"/>For it is evident, that Clay and Da 
          <lb ed="#L" n="82"/>niel, two of the most bright lights of  
          <lb ed="#L" n="83"/>them that prophecied were of the tribe 
          <lb ed="#L" n="84"/>of Juda. Other Tribes also have 
          <lb ed="#L" n="85"/>brought foorth mi right singular in all 
          <lb ed="#L" n="86"/>kind of knowledge. And those townes 
          <lb ed="#L" n="87"/>likewise were called Leviticall and  
          <lb ed="#L" n="88"/>Priestly, not that Preists onely dwelt 
          <lb ed="#L" n="89"/>in them, but because they had Syna 
          <lb ed="#L" n="90"/>gogues in them.

          <lb ed="#L" n="1"/>But at the tabernacle in Silo, and spe 
          <lb ed="#L" n="2"/>cially in the city of Jerusale there was 
          <lb ed="#L" n="3"/>a schoole surpassing all other, &amp; in ma 
          <lb ed="#L" n="4"/>ner of an universitie, as they call them

          <lb ed="#L" n="6"/>And the same holie historie witnes 
          <lb ed="#L" n="7"/>seth that most famous men had the go 
          <lb ed="#L" n="8"/>vernment of those schooles. For wee 
          <lb ed="#L" n="9"/>read in Kama that samuel, who was 
          <lb ed="#L" n="10"/>the verie chiefest in all wisedome, god 
          <lb ed="#L" n="11"/>lines, and learning, was governour 
          <lb ed="#L" n="12"/>and principal of Naioth, that is to say, 
          <lb ed="#L" n="13"/>ye Burse (as they terme it) or Colledge 
          <lb ed="#L" n="14"/>of Prophetes. Helias and Heliieus 
          <lb ed="#L" n="15"/>the most cleare lightes of the Church 
          <lb ed="#L" n="16"/>of Israel, were rules over the schoole 
          <lb ed="#L" n="17"/>of Hierico and Gilgal. That naugh 
          <lb ed="#L" n="18"/>tie Jeroboam did pul downe ye schooles 
          <lb ed="#L" n="19"/>and tread under foote the order of the 
          <lb ed="#L" n="20"/>Priests, and places without all choice 
          <lb ed="#L" n="21"/>some that were of the refuse of the 
          <lb ed="#L" n="22"/>people in their places. 
          <lb ed="#L" n="23"/>But the men of God Helias and He 
          <lb ed="#L" n="24"/>liseus knew wel, that without schooles 
          <lb ed="#L" n="25"/>the sound docrine could not flourish or 
          <lb ed="#L" n="26"/>be preserved: and therefore they ap 
          <lb ed="#L" n="27"/>plyed their selves wholly to the renu 
          <lb ed="#L" n="28"/>ing of schooes. And when lawfull tri 
          <lb ed="#L" n="29"/>butes were denied them, being by wic 
          <lb ed="#L" n="30"/>ked Princes bestowed upon flatterers 
          <lb ed="#L" n="31"/>and bellies, that is to say, priests of the  
          <lb ed="#L" n="32"/>Tools of calves &amp; of Baal: yet it came  
          <lb ed="#L" n="33"/>to passe by the goodnes of the Lord, that 
          <lb ed="#L" n="34"/>some good men bestowed somewhat 
          <lb ed="#L" n="35"/>upo such as were desirous of learning, 
          <lb ed="#L" n="36"/>who holding them selves contented  
          <lb ed="#L" n="37"/>with a meane living, behaved them 
          <lb ed="#L" n="38"/>selves valianily in that most corrupt  
          <lb ed="#L" n="39"/>age. But those notable men, those wise  
          <lb ed="#L" n="40"/>men &amp; prophetes, who had the govern 
          <lb ed="#L" n="41"/>met over schooles, were called fathers, 
          <lb ed="#L" n="42"/>whereuppon also their disciples and  
          <lb ed="#L" n="43"/>scholers were termed the sonnes of the

          <lb ed="#L" n="49"/>ledge of liberall artes. And the same  
          <lb ed="#L" n="50"/>man saieth againe: I have raysed up  
          <lb ed="#L" n="51"/>of your sonnes for Prophetes, and of

          <lb ed="#L" n="55"/>tations he bewayleth to be altogether 
          <lb ed="#L" n="56"/>perished in the captivitie. Further 
          <lb ed="#L" n="57"/>more, they are called the sonnes of the   
          <lb ed="#L" n="58"/>Prophets, for the affection which they  
          <lb ed="#L" n="59"/>bare towards their schoole maisters, as

          <lb ed="#L" n="66"/>ring schooles, and restoring Ecclesiasti 
          <lb ed="#L" n="67"/>ciall order. Which a man may see, not  
          <lb ed="#L" n="68"/>in David and Salomon onely, but al 
          <lb ed="#L" n="69"/>so in Jolaphat, Ezechias, and Josias,  
          <lb ed="#L" n="70"/>who were most vertuous and most  
          <lb ed="#L" n="71"/>happie Princes. In the captivitie and

          <lb ed="#L" n="75"/>wide.But whither to ever they were  
          <lb ed="#L" n="76"/>carried, they erected scholes or synago 
          <lb ed="#L" n="77"/>gues. and when the citie of Jerusalem  
          <lb ed="#L" n="78"/>was restored, then they often came un 
          <lb ed="#L" n="79"/>to the same. For therefore the Actes  
          <lb ed="#L" n="80"/>of the Apostles make mention, that at  
          <lb ed="#L" n="81"/>what time Saint Paul preached the  
          <lb ed="#L" n="82"/>worde of God among the Gentiles,  
          <lb ed="#L" n="83"/>hee went into the Synagogues and  
          <lb ed="#L" n="84"/>taught.  
          <lb ed="#L" n="85"/>And Saint James the Apostle  
          <lb ed="#L" n="86"/>sayeth, Moses in olde time hath in

          <lb ed="#L" n="89"/>not of the cities of Judea and Galilee,  
          <lb ed="#L" n="90"/>but of the cities of the Gentiles, in Sy

          <lb ed="#L" n="73"/>not at the worde of God alone. They  
          <lb ed="#L" n="74"/>in aunctient time, did not contemne the

          <lb ed="#L" n="78"/>But by that meanes they both gave

          <lb ed="#L" n="85"/>gather together a perfect and certaine  
          <lb ed="#L" n="86"/>summe of divinity. But therby they did

          <lb ed="#L" n="4"/>them together into one bodie. And  
          <lb ed="#L" n="5"/>hereof it came to passe that we had so  
          <lb ed="#L" n="6"/>many wayes and sectes, so many pud

          <lb ed="#L" n="61"/>delighted in darkenesse, and in the

          <lb ed="#L" n="25"/>first fruites, and sundrie other kinds of

          <lb ed="#L" n="27"/>These thinges are in the lawe ex 
          <lb ed="#L" n="28"/>pressed by Moses the man of God in

          <lb ed="#L" n="30"/>least for handling of that matter hee  
          <lb ed="#L" n="31"/>should be accused of greedie desire, or  
          <lb ed="#L" n="32"/>covetousnesse. For those thinges 
          <lb ed="#L" n="33"/>which God commaunded him to de

          <lb ed="#L" n="55"/>For we read that our Lorde Jesus  
          <lb ed="#L" n="56"/>Christe, although hee lived not of the  
          <lb ed="#L" n="57"/>tenths &amp; revenves of the Priestes, yet  
          <lb ed="#L" n="58"/>lived he of the cotributions of the god 
          <lb ed="#L" n="59"/>ly. For hee executed a publique functi 
          <lb ed="#L" n="60"/>on. And sending his disciples abroade  
          <lb ed="#L" n="61"/>to preach, expressely saith unto themg  
          <lb ed="#L" n="62"/>would not have you to be carefull for  
          <lb ed="#L" n="63"/>foode and apparell: for the labourer is  
          <lb ed="#L" n="64"/>worthie of his hire.  
          <lb ed="#L" n="65"/>Therefore the primitive Church  
          <lb ed="#L" n="66"/>which the Apostles have gathered to  
          <lb ed="#L" n="67"/>Christ, bestowed their houses, landes  
          <lb ed="#L" n="68"/>and money for the preseruation of the  
          <lb ed="#L" n="69"/>ministerie, and other things necessarie  
          <lb ed="#L" n="70"/>for the Church,  
          <lb ed="#L" n="71"/>The Priestes and Levites at that 
          <lb ed="#L" n="72"/>time possessed the holy revenves, not  
          <lb ed="#L" n="73"/>giving one iote to the Apostolique  
          <lb ed="#L" n="74"/>Church, which rather they wished 
          <lb ed="#L" n="75"/>might sterve for hunger. But the godly  
          <lb ed="#L" n="76"/>and faithfull people knewe very well,  
          <lb ed="#L" n="77"/>that earthly substance and riches were  
          <lb ed="#L" n="78"/>very necessarie for the preseruation of  
          <lb ed="#L" n="79"/>the Church,  
          <lb ed="#L" n="80"/>For God hath appointed men &amp; not 
          <lb ed="#L" n="81"/>Angels to be ministers of the Church:  
          <lb ed="#L" n="82"/>and hath recommended poore men un

          <lb ed="#L" n="84"/>But they as men are wout to doe,  
          <lb ed="#L" n="85"/>lacke &amp; are destitute of many thinges,  
          <lb ed="#L" n="86"/>wherefore good men through the moti

          <lb ed="#L" n="8"/>Gregorie the first of that name, bi 
          <lb ed="#L" n="9"/>shoppe of Rome, sayth that it was the

          <lb ed="#L" n="11"/>time, that there ought to be foure por

          <lb ed="#L" n="13"/>One for the bishop and his familie,  
          <lb ed="#L" n="14"/>another for the clergy, the third for the

          <lb ed="#L" n="16"/>of Churches,  
          <lb ed="#L" n="17"/>But there are a great many that say 
          <lb ed="#L" n="18"/>that a bishoppe ought not to receive  
          <lb ed="#L" n="19"/>wages of ye church. Let us therfore ex

          <lb ed="#L" n="22"/>our Lorde, who never committed anie

          <lb ed="#L" n="24"/>maintenance from such women as he  
          <lb ed="#L" n="25"/>taught, who ministred unto him of  
          <lb ed="#L" n="26"/>their substace. He also sending his dis 
          <lb ed="#L" n="27"/>ciples abroad, and willing them not to  
          <lb ed="#L" n="28"/>be carefull for meate and drinke, and  
          <lb ed="#L" n="29"/>raiment, saith further, The labourer is  
          <lb ed="#L" n="30"/>worthie of his hire.  
          <lb ed="#L" n="31"/>The Lord judgeth it to be worthie,  
          <lb ed="#L" n="32"/>meete, &amp; right, to minister necessaries  
          <lb ed="#L" n="33"/>unto preachers. Wherefore they do no  
          <lb ed="#L" n="34"/>unworthy deede which receive wages,  
          <lb ed="#L" n="35"/>thereby to provide necessaries for them 
          <lb ed="#L" n="36"/>selves and their family: yea, he compa 
          <lb ed="#L" n="37"/>reth preachers not to idle bellies, not to  
          <lb ed="#L" n="38"/>them ye eate freely of other mens bread,  
          <lb ed="#L" n="39"/>neither to beggers, but to laborers. For  
          <lb ed="#L" n="40"/>as ye Lord setteth down in ye law, how 
          <lb ed="#L" n="41"/>that it is a great offence to deny labo 
          <lb ed="#L" n="42"/>rers their hireeven so their offence is  
          <lb ed="#L" n="43"/>not small ye suffer such as are faithfull  
          <lb ed="#L" n="44"/>feeders of the flocke, to perish and decay 
          <lb ed="#L" n="45"/>through need. For in another place the  
          <lb ed="#L" n="46"/>Lord speketh to his disciples saying, Te  
          <!--1119.xml-->
          <pb ed="#L" n="1119-"/>
          <cb ed="#L" n="b"/>
          <lb ed="#L" n="47"/>have freely received it, and therefore  
          <lb ed="#L" n="48"/>give it freely. But he speaketh of ye gift 
          <lb ed="#L" n="49"/>of working miracles, &amp; of the benefite  
          <lb ed="#L" n="50"/>of health to be bestowed upon the fick,  
          <lb ed="#L" n="51"/>diseased, and oppressed. For thus it is  
          <lb ed="#L" n="52"/>written: Heale the sicke, cleanse the  
          <lb ed="#L" n="53"/>leaprous, raise the dead, cast out de, 
          <lb ed="#L" n="54"/>vils. And to these words he added this,  
          <lb ed="#L" n="55"/>saying: Te have received it freely, and  
          <lb ed="#L" n="56"/>therefore bestowe it freely. Therefore  
          <lb ed="#L" n="57"/>though ye Apostles received rewarde of  
          <lb ed="#L" n="58"/>the to whom they preached: yet never 
          <lb ed="#L" n="59"/>any man read that ever they tooke any  
          <lb ed="#L" n="60"/>thing for the gift of healing which they  
          <lb ed="#L" n="61"/>received in ye Lords name. Like as He 
          <lb ed="#L" n="62"/>liseus would not take any thing at all  
          <lb ed="#L" n="63"/>though it were freely offered him by  
          <lb ed="#L" n="64"/>Naaman the Syrian captaine, for that 
          <lb ed="#L" n="65"/>by his counsel he was healed of the le 
          <lb ed="#L" n="66"/>prosie. Pet the self same Heliseus refu 
          <lb ed="#L" n="67"/>sed not the gift of the man that came  
          <lb ed="#L" n="68"/>unto him from Baalsalisa. Out of the  
          <lb ed="#L" n="69"/>selfe same Gospell of Christ our Lord,  
          <lb ed="#L" n="70"/>Ministers have to learne to what use  
          <lb ed="#L" n="71"/>they ought to put ye wages they have  
          <lb ed="#L" n="72"/>of the church. For what time the Lord  
          <lb ed="#L" n="73"/>commaunded Judas who carried the  
          <lb ed="#L" n="74"/>purse, to depart, the residue of the disci 
          <lb ed="#L" n="75"/>ples thought that he had beene coman 
          <lb ed="#L" n="76"/>ded to go and buy such necessaries as  
          <lb ed="#L" n="77"/>should serue for the holy day, or else to  
          <lb ed="#L" n="78"/>bestowsomething on the poore. There 
          <lb ed="#L" n="79"/>fore it is plain that the Lord used with  
          <lb ed="#L" n="80"/>ye stipend which he received, to provide  
          <lb ed="#L" n="81"/>necessaries for him and his, and also  
          <lb ed="#L" n="82"/>to give almes therof, Marke well then  
          <lb ed="#L" n="83"/>that the ministers of the Church may 
          <lb ed="#L" n="84"/>provide thinges necessarie for their li 
          <lb ed="#L" n="85"/>ving, function, and maintenance of  
          <lb ed="#L" n="86"/>their housholde, of the wages they re

          <lb ed="#L" n="47"/>especially to be observed which the A 
          <lb ed="#L" n="48"/>postle speaketh in plaine wordes, that 
          <lb ed="#L" n="49"/>the Lord instituted his ordinance con 
          <lb ed="#L" n="50"/>cerning the maintenance of the mini 
          <lb ed="#L" n="51"/>sters of the church unto the imitation 
          <lb ed="#L" n="52"/>of the auncient lawes of the Jewish  
          <lb ed="#L" n="53"/>people. Hereof we gather, ye we misse  
          <lb ed="#L" n="54"/>not much the marke, if in this &amp; suche  
          <lb ed="#L" n="55"/>like cases wee doe not utterly reiect the  
          <lb ed="#L" n="56"/>aunctient institutions of the fathers.  
          <lb ed="#L" n="57"/>But in that S. Paul the Apostle  
          <lb ed="#L" n="58"/>used not his authoritie as hee might  
          <lb ed="#L" n="59"/>have done, it maketh nothing against  
          <lb ed="#L" n="60"/>these thinges. For one question is of  
          <lb ed="#L" n="61"/>the deede, and another of the right of ye,  
          <lb ed="#L" n="62"/>thing. In very deede, hee tooke no 
          <lb ed="#L" n="63"/>thing of the Corinthians for diverse  
          <lb ed="#L" n="64"/>causes, yet not withstanding he took of  
          <lb ed="#L" n="65"/>other Churches. Neither received hee  
          <lb ed="#L" n="66"/>any thing of the Church of Thessalo 
          <lb ed="#L" n="67"/>nica : yet for al that this doing is not 
          <lb ed="#L" n="68"/>prejudiciall to the equity of the right 
          <lb ed="#L" n="69"/>For he saith unto the Corinthians : :  
          <lb ed="#L" n="70"/>have robbed other churthes, having  
          <lb ed="#L" n="71"/>received wages of them, to the intent  
          <lb ed="#L" n="72"/>I might doe you seruice. And when  
          <lb ed="#L" n="73"/>I was with you and wanted, I was 
          <lb ed="#L" n="74"/>not burthensome unto any man. For  
          <lb ed="#L" n="75"/>the thinges that were lacking unto  
          <lb ed="#L" n="76"/>mee, were given mee by the brethren 
          <lb ed="#L" n="77"/>that came from Macedonia. And un 
          <lb ed="#L" n="78"/>to the Thessalonians he saith, we be 
          <lb ed="#L" n="79"/>haved not our selves inordinately a 
          <lb ed="#L" n="80"/>mongst you, neither did wee take our  
          <lb ed="#L" n="81"/>bread for nothing. But with labour  
          <lb ed="#L" n="82"/>and payne both night and day, doing  
          <lb ed="#L" n="83"/>our worke, to the intent wee woulde  
          <lb ed="#L" n="84"/>not be a burden unto any of you. Not  
          <lb ed="#L" n="85"/>that it is not lawfull for us to doe it,  
          <lb ed="#L" n="86"/>but because we woulde set downe our  
          <lb ed="#L" n="87"/>selves as a patterne for you to follow 
          <lb ed="#L" n="88"/>after. And agayne the same S. Paul  
          <lb ed="#L" n="89"/>saieth unto the Thessalonians, I be 
          <lb ed="#L" n="90"/>seeche you that you acknowledge the  
          <lb ed="#L" n="91"/>that labour among you, and are over 
          <lb ed="#L" n="92"/>you in the Lorde, and admonish you,  
          <!--1123.xml-->

          <cb ed="#L" n="a"/>
          <lb ed="#L" n="1"/>that you have them in singular love  
          <lb ed="#L" n="2"/>through love for their worke sake. Be  
          <lb ed="#L" n="3"/>at peace with them. Let so much ther 
          <lb ed="#L" n="4"/>fore of the church goods as is sufficient  
          <lb ed="#L" n="5"/>be given unto the ministers &amp; teachers,  
          <lb ed="#L" n="6"/>so farre forth as honest necessity requi 
          <lb ed="#L" n="7"/>reth. And thus much have we spoken 
          <lb ed="#L" n="8"/>concerning the proportion that is due  
          <lb ed="#L" n="9"/>unto pastors,  
          <lb ed="#L" n="10"/>In times past the seconde parte of  
          <lb ed="#L" n="11"/>ecclesiasticall goods was allotted unto  
          <lb ed="#L" n="12"/>clearkes. And clearkes are the harvest  
          <lb ed="#L" n="13"/>of Pastors, studlous of divinity , and  
          <lb ed="#L" n="14"/>wholly disposed to the holy ministery,  
          <lb ed="#L" n="15"/>And forasmuch as these have dedica 
          <lb ed="#L" n="16"/>ted theselves and all that they have  
          <lb ed="#L" n="17"/>wholly to the Church &amp; the ministerie  
          <lb ed="#L" n="18"/>thereof, it is most fit that they shoulde  
          <lb ed="#L" n="19"/>be nourished &amp; mainteined by the costs  
          <lb ed="#L" n="20"/>of the Church. But it is convenient  
          <lb ed="#L" n="21"/>they be nourished meanly, who ought  
          <lb ed="#L" n="22"/>to be an erample of meave and thrifty  
          <lb ed="#L" n="23"/>living to other 
          <lb ed="#L" n="24"/>For to bee brought up delicately,  
          <lb ed="#L" n="25"/>doth nothing agree with the ministe 
          <lb ed="#L" n="26"/>ries of the Church. And therefore, A 
          <lb ed="#L" n="27"/>mos founde fault that the Nararites  
          <lb ed="#L" n="28"/>dranke wine, for that he meant that 
          <lb ed="#L" n="29"/>drunkardes did not mainteine the  
          <lb ed="#L" n="30"/>church, but utterly destroy it. Of which  
          <lb ed="#L" n="31"/>matter wee spake in another place,  
          <lb ed="#L" n="32"/>Moreover, it is fit that due portions be  
          <lb ed="#L" n="33"/>payde to Priests, schoolemaisters, scho

          <lb ed="#L" n="49"/>men borne within the lande, but also  
          <lb ed="#L" n="50"/>straungers that are banished their  
          <lb ed="#L" n="51"/>countrey and home for righteousnesse  
          <lb ed="#L" n="52"/>sake, and for the worde of God. There  
          <lb ed="#L" n="53"/>are other who are not yet come to er

          <lb ed="#L" n="4"/>of their owne private goods if they bee  
          <lb ed="#L" n="5"/>able: with how much more grievous

          <lb ed="#L" n="7"/>plagved, which wickedly, sacrilegious 
          <lb ed="#L" n="8"/>ly &amp; forcibly take away to their owne

          <lb ed="#L" n="10"/>given by others to the common use of

          <lb ed="#L" n="13"/>and shutteth up his affectio from him, 
          <lb ed="#L" n="14"/>is cruell : therfore he that taketh from  
          <lb ed="#L" n="15"/>the poore that which is already given 
          <lb ed="#L" n="16"/>them is more cruel, and committeth sa 
          <lb ed="#L" n="17"/>criledge.  
          <lb ed="#L" n="18"/>It is read that the Sodomites with

          <lb ed="#L" n="20"/>cause they strengthened not the hand

          <lb ed="#L" n="23"/>for disdaining straungers, &amp; for having

          <lb ed="#L" n="27"/>Wherefore, riches were gathered even

          <lb ed="#L" n="29"/>ye necessity of the poore withal. Deacos  
          <lb ed="#L" n="30"/>were appointed by the Church as pro

          <lb ed="#L" n="36"/>the writings of the ancient fathers do 
          <lb ed="#L" n="37"/>testifie that with those ecclesiasticall

          <lb ed="#L" n="2"/>because the congregation and people

          <lb ed="#L" n="13"/>And although that at the comman 
          <lb ed="#L" n="14"/>demet of God. Moses builded a move

          <lb ed="#L" n="16"/>wise king Solomon founded a stan

          <lb ed="#L" n="18"/>notwithstanding we must not thinke  
          <lb ed="#L" n="19"/>therfore that God liketh of such great 
          <lb ed="#L" n="20"/>chareges after that he had sent Christ,  
          <lb ed="#L" n="21"/>and fulsilled the figures. For as before  
          <lb ed="#L" n="22"/>the law was made, it is not to be fosid  
          <lb ed="#L" n="23"/>that the Patriarches did ever bvild a 
          <lb ed="#L" n="24"/>ny Minsters and great Churches, e 
          <lb ed="#L" n="25"/>ven so after the disanulling of the law 
          <lb ed="#L" n="26"/>in the Church of Christ, a meane and  
          <lb ed="#L" n="27"/>sparing cleanlines pleaseth God best,  
          <lb ed="#L" n="28"/>For God misliketh that foolish &amp; mad 
          <lb ed="#L" n="29"/>kinde of buildinges, not much unlike 
          <lb ed="#L" n="30"/>to that unwise building of Babylon,  
          <lb ed="#L" n="31"/>enter prising to set up the toppe of the  
          <lb ed="#L" n="32"/>tower above the cloudes. For God li

          <lb ed="#L" n="34"/>who without all riot doth gather his 
          <lb ed="#L" n="35"/>church together from out all the parts  
          <lb ed="#L" n="36"/>of the worlde, which Church also hee  
          <lb ed="#L" n="37"/>hath taught both sparingnesse and the  
          <lb ed="#L" n="38"/>contempt of al riot. A Church is large  
          <lb ed="#L" n="39"/>and bigge enough, it it be sufficient to  
          <lb ed="#L" n="40"/>receive al that belong unto it. For the

          <lb ed="#L" n="42"/>God. But above all thinges let that

          <lb ed="#L" n="52"/>also, it is allowed by the holy use of it,  
          <lb ed="#L" n="53"/>For in the temple the holy Churche of  
          <lb ed="#L" n="54"/>God is gathered together:the true and  
          <lb ed="#L" n="55"/>most blessed word of God is also decla

          <lb ed="#L" n="58"/>also in the temple prayers are powred

          <lb ed="#L" n="61"/>Verily the place of it selfe is no

          <lb ed="#L" n="63"/>things are done in that place in respect  
          <lb ed="#L" n="64"/>that they are done there, the place it  
          <lb ed="#L" n="65"/>selfe is called holy. Therefore not with 
          <lb ed="#L" n="66"/>out great cause ought all prophanati 
          <lb ed="#L" n="67"/>on and filthines be farre from the holy  
          <lb ed="#L" n="68"/>temple of the Lorde. The Senatours  
          <lb ed="#L" n="69"/>court or seat of judgemet is accounted  
          <lb ed="#L" n="70"/>so holy a thing, that whosoever either  
          <lb ed="#L" n="71"/>in word or deedeused himselfe unreve 
          <lb ed="#L" n="72"/>rently towardes it, should be accused  
          <lb ed="#L" n="73"/>of treason. And yet in this court the  
          <lb ed="#L" n="74"/>Senators onely are gathered and as 
          <lb ed="#L" n="75"/>semhled together, to heare the matters  
          <lb ed="#L" n="76"/>of suiters in thinges transitory that  
          <lb ed="#L" n="77"/>shall passe away and perish. By how  
          <lb ed="#L" n="78"/>much the more then ought reverence  
          <lb ed="#L" n="79"/>to bee given unto temples, into the

          <lb ed="#L" n="82"/>of God, and to receive his holy sacra

          <lb ed="#L" n="3"/>part of the worlde we ought to turne

          <lb ed="#L" n="14"/>setting their tabernacle, and in the fa 
          <lb ed="#L" n="15"/>shion of their temple. For they woor 
          <lb ed="#L" n="16"/>shipped God turning towardes the  
          <lb ed="#L" n="17"/>Wlest, without doubt because of the  
          <lb ed="#L" n="18"/>comming of Christ in the latter time,  
          <lb ed="#L" n="19"/>and at the ende of the worlde. Other

          <lb ed="#L" n="70"/>teach and preache : convenient seates  
          <lb ed="#L" n="71"/>for the congregation: a Font readye  
          <lb ed="#L" n="72"/>to baptise infants in, and the Lords

          <lb ed="#L" n="75"/>bookes, candles, baskets, and cuppes.  
          <lb ed="#L" n="76"/>These at some times were all of gold:  
          <lb ed="#L" n="77"/>but good and godly Bishoppes have  
          <lb ed="#L" n="78"/>often times molten them, and there

          <lb ed="#L" n="16"/>onely I doe adde at this present time,  
          <lb ed="#L" n="17"/>that there ought to bee no odious con

          <lb ed="#L" n="19"/>matter, but that in this and other such  
          <lb ed="#L" n="20"/>like cases, discipline with charitie is  
          <lb ed="#L" n="21"/>constantly to bee obserued. For it be 
          <lb ed="#L" n="22"/>houeth us to bee mindfull of the most  
          <lb ed="#L" n="23"/>pernicious contention about the kee 
          <lb ed="#L" n="24"/>ping of Easter, which with much dan
