          <lb ed="#L" n="1"/>Let us first of all 
          <lb ed="#L" n="2"/> pray to our God 
          <lb ed="#L" n="3"/> ye he will vouch 
          <lb ed="#L" n="4"/> safe to graunt us

          <lb ed="#L" n="9"/> the otehr Articles of Christian be
          <lb ed="#L" n="10"/> leefe.
      </p>
      <p>
          <lb ed="#L" n="11"/> the fift Article of our beleefe is:
          <lb ed="#L" n="12"/><quote>The third day he rose againe from the 
          <lb ed="#L" n="13"/>dead.</quote> And this Article verily of 
          <lb ed="#L" n="14"/>our beleefe is in a manner the chiefe 
          <lb ed="#L" n="15"/> of all the rest. Neither are the A
          <lb ed="#L" n="16"/>postles so busily occupied in delcaring 
          <lb ed="#L" n="17"/>and confirming the other, as they
          <lb ed="#L" n="18"/>are in this one. For it had not been 
          <lb ed="#L" n="19"/>ynough, if our Lord had died onely,
          <lb ed="#L" n="20"/> unlesse he had also risen from the dead 
          <lb ed="#L" n="21"/> againe. For if hee had not risen from 
          <lb ed="#L" n="22"/> the dead, but had remained still in 
          <lb ed="#L" n="23"/>death, who shoulde have perswaded 
          <lb ed="#L" n="24"/> us men, that sinne was purged by 
          <lb ed="#L" n="25"/> the death of Christ, that death was 
          <lb ed="#L" n="26"/>vanquished, Sathan overcome, and 
          <lb ed="#L" n="27"/>Hell broken uppe for the faithfull by 
          <lb ed="#L" n="28"/>the death of Christ? Yea verily wee 
          <lb ed="#L" n="29"/>have foolish fellowes that woulde 
          <lb ed="#L" n="30"/>never cease to blaspheme the verie 
          <lb ed="#L" n="31"/>God, to make a mocked of our hope, 
          <lb ed="#L" n="32"/>and to say: Tush, who did ever re
          <lb ed="#L" n="33"/>turne from the dead, to tell us whe
          <lb ed="#L" n="34"/>ther there be a life in an other worlde 
          <lb ed="#L" n="35"/>after this or no, and what kind of life 
          <lb ed="#L" n="36"/>it is? 
      </p>
      <p>
          <lb ed="#L" n="37"/>Because therefore we cannot finde
          <cb ed="#L" n="c"/>
          <lb ed="#L" n="1"/>that anie man did ever returne from 
          <lb ed="#L" n="2"/>the dead, that is to bee doubted of 
          <lb ed="#L" n="3"/>which these bablers do tatle touching 
          <lb ed="#L" n="4"/>the life of the worlde to come.
      </p>
      <p>
          <lb ed="#L" n="5"/>That the Lorde therefore might de
          <lb ed="#L" n="6"/>clare to the whole worlde, taht after
          <lb ed="#L" n="7"/>this life there is an other, and that the 
          <lb ed="#L" n="8"/>soule dieth not with the bodie, but 
          <lb ed="#L" n="9"/>remaineth alive, hee returned the 
          <lb ed="#L" n="10"/>third day alive againe to his Disci
          <lb ed="#L" n="11"/>ples: and at that instant shewed them, 
          <lb ed="#L" n="12"/>that sinne was purged, death disar
          <lb ed="#L" n="13"/>med, the divell vanquished, and hell 
          <lb ed="#L" n="14"/>destroyed.
      </p>
      <p>
          <lb ed="#L" n="15"/>For the sting of death is sinne. Or 
          <lb ed="#L" n="16"/>the reward of sinne is death. The di
          <lb ed="#L" n="17"/>vil hath the power of death, and shut
          <lb ed="#L" n="18"/>teth in hell for sinnes. Now therefore, 
          <lb ed="#L" n="19"/>in that Christ riseth alive againe from 
          <lb ed="#L" n="20"/>the dead. Death could have no domi
          <lb ed="#L" n="21"/>nion over him: and because Death by 
          <lb ed="#L" n="22"/>suffering the Lord to passe, is broken, 
          <lb ed="#L" n="23"/>It must needes followe, that the Di
          <lb ed="#L" n="24"/>vell, and Hell, are vanquished by 
          <lb ed="#L" n="25"/>Christ. And lastly, that Sinne, the 
          <lb ed="#L" n="26"/>strength and power of them all is 
          <lb ed="#L" n="27"/>purely purged.
      </p>
      <p>
          <lb ed="#L" n="28"/>It is evident therefore, that the 
          <lb ed="#L" n="29"/>resurrection of our Lord Jesus Christ 
          <lb ed="#L" n="30"/>doth as it were, certifie and by seale 
          <lb ed="#L" n="31"/>assure us of our salvation and Re
          <lb ed="#L" n="32"/>demption, so that now wee can not
          <lb ed="#L" n="33"/>anie longer doubt of it. Wee con 
          <lb ed="#L" n="34"/>fesse therefore in this Article, that 
          <lb ed="#L" n="35"/>our Lorde Jesus Christ is risen a
          <lb ed="#L" n="36"/>gaine, and that he is risen againe

          <lb ed="#L" n="3"/>that for us he hath conquered death, ye

      </p>
      <p>
          <lb ed="#L" n="10"/>So then I suppose that briefly thus 
          <lb ed="#L" n="11"/>I have well declared what manner of 
          <lb ed="#L" n="12"/>place heaven is, to wit, a place of qui
          <lb ed="#L" n="13"/>etnesse, joy, and everlasting felicitie, 
          <lb ed="#L" n="14"/>wherein the sonne of God doth sit, doth 
          <lb ed="#L" n="15"/>dwell, and is in his humanitie, as we 
          <lb ed="#L" n="16"/>also, that are the members of Christ, 
          <lb ed="#L" n="17"/>shalbe in the verie same place without 
          <lb ed="#L" n="18"/>all dolour and griefe in joye for ever 
          <lb ed="#L" n="19"/>more. And although our Lorde be de
          <lb ed="#L" n="20"/>livered from all grievous businesse, 
          <lb ed="#L" n="21"/>yet we meane not that he sitteth idel
          <lb ed="#L" n="22"/>ly leaning on his elbowes. For he is a 
          <lb ed="#L" n="23"/>king, a Priest, and verie God in the 
          <lb ed="#L" n="24"/>verie temple of God: he cannot choose 
          <lb ed="#L" n="25"/>therefore of his naturall propertie and 
          <lb ed="#L" n="26"/>office but work salvation in the elect, 
          <lb ed="#L" n="27"/>and do all things, that lie God a king, 
          <lb ed="#L" n="28"/>and Priest in hande to doe. So then 
          <lb ed="#L" n="29"/>nowe we all knowe what our Lorde 
          <lb ed="#L" n="30"/>doth as he sitteth in heaven. Neither 
          <lb ed="#L" n="31"/>is it any trouble to him at al to do and 
          <lb ed="#L" n="32"/>worke that which he doth, for he wor
          <lb ed="#L" n="33"/>keth not of compulsion, but naturally 
          <lb ed="#L" n="34"/>and of his owne accorde.

      <p>
          <lb ed="#L" n="35"/>Thus and no otherwise did the an

          <lb ed="#L" n="38"/>Some of whose testimonies I will 
          <lb ed="#L" n="39"/>here alledge. <name>Saint Hierome</name> in his 
          <lb ed="#L" n="40"/>exposition of <name>Paules</name> first Chapter to 
          <lb ed="#L" n="41"/>the Ephesians, saith: <quote>he hath decla
          <lb ed="#L" n="42"/>red the power of God by the simili
          <lb ed="#L" n="43"/>tude of a man: not because a seate is 
          <lb ed="#L" n="44"/>placed and God the father sitteth ther 
          <lb ed="#L" n="45"/>on, having his sonne sitting there with 
          <lb ed="#L" n="46"/>him: but because we cannot other
          <!-- 73.xml -->
          <cb ed="#L" n="b"/>
          <lb ed="#L" n="1"/>wise conceive howe the sonne dooth 
          <lb ed="#L" n="2"/>judge and reigne, but by such wordes 
          <lb ed="#L" n="3"/>applyed to our capacitie. As therefore 
          <lb ed="#L" n="4"/>to be next to God, or to depart farre 
          <lb ed="#L" n="5"/>from him is not to be understood ac
          <lb ed="#L" n="6"/>cording to the distance of places, but 
          <lb ed="#L" n="7"/>after mens merites, because the saints 
          <lb ed="#L" n="8"/>are heard by him, but the sinnes (of
          <lb ed="#L" n="9"/>whome the Prophete saieth, Beholde 
          <lb ed="#L" n="10"/>they that gette themselves from thee 
          <lb ed="#L" n="11"/>shall perish) are removed farre enough 
          <lb ed="#L" n="12"/>for comming neare him at all. Even so 
          <lb ed="#L" n="13"/>likewise to bee eyther at the right of 
          <lb ed="#L" n="14"/>left hande of God is to bee taken so, 
          <lb ed="#L" n="15"/>that the saints are at his right hand and 
          <lb ed="#L" n="16"/>sinners at his left. As our saviour 
          <lb ed="#L" n="17"/>him selfe also in the Gospell affirming 
          <lb ed="#L" n="18"/>the same doeth say, that at the right 
          <lb ed="#L" n="19"/>hand are the sheepe, and the goates 
          <lb ed="#L" n="20"/>at the left. Moreover this verie word 
          <lb ed="#L" n="21"/>(to Sit) doeth argue the power of a

          <lb ed="#L" n="24"/>safe to sit, in so much as verilie he doth 
          <lb ed="#L" n="25"/>rule them, and hath them alwayes in 
          <lb ed="#L" n="26"/>his guiding, &amp; doth turne to his owne

          <lb ed="#L" n="34"/>though we shoulde thinke that God 
          <lb ed="#L" n="35"/>the Father is comprehended within

          <lb ed="#L" n="2"/>it is to place God in such a likenesse in 
          <lb ed="#L" n="3"/>a Christian Church: and much more

          <lb ed="#L" n="8"/>fore understand that at the right hand 
          <lb ed="#L" n="9"/>is as much to say as in greatest happi

          <lb ed="#L" n="16"/>meant the placing of his lims, but his
