          <lb ed="#S" n="8"/>mate in wedlocke:  
          <lb ed="#S" n="9"/>For by wedlock

          <lb ed="#S" n="11"/>ned together, and  
          <lb ed="#S" n="12"/>are made one. For the Lord said: And  
          <lb ed="#S" n="13"/>two shall be one flesh. In this thirde  
          <lb ed="#S" n="14"/>precept therefore which is next after  
          <lb ed="#S" n="15"/>the forbidding of murther, commaun 
          <lb ed="#S" n="16"/>dement is given for the holie keeping  
          <lb ed="#S" n="17"/>of honourable wedlocke, and for the

          <lb ed="#S" n="21"/>this end and purpose, that honestie &amp;

          <lb ed="#S" n="23"/>and children may be brought up in the  
          <lb ed="#S" n="24"/>feare of the Lord. This commaunde 
          <lb ed="#S" n="25"/>ment againe is briefly expressed in as  
          <lb ed="#S" n="26"/>fewe wordes as may be: Thou shalt  
          <lb ed="#S" n="27"/>not commit adulterie. In the exposi 
          <lb ed="#S" n="28"/>tion of this commaundement by the  
          <lb ed="#S" n="29"/>helpe of Gods good spirite, I will first  
          <lb ed="#S" n="30"/>speake of holy matrimonie, then of a 
          <lb ed="#S" n="31"/>dulterie: thirdly I will shew you what  
          <lb ed="#S" n="32"/>is conteined under the name of adul 
          <lb ed="#S" n="33"/>terie: and lastly I will make an ende  
          <lb ed="#S" n="34"/>with a treatise of continencie.  
          <lb ed="#S" n="35"/>Wedlocke, which is also called ma 
          <lb ed="#S" n="36"/>trimonie, is an alliaunce of holy joy

          <lb ed="#S" n="38"/>pled and brought into one by mutuall

          <lb ed="#S" n="43"/>feare of the Lord. The Gospel verilie  
          <lb ed="#S" n="44"/>calleth wedlock a joyning together,  
          <lb ed="#S" n="45"/>which god hath made. for Christ said:  
          <lb ed="#S" n="46"/>What god hath joyned together, let  
          <lb ed="#S" n="47"/>no man separate. Neither is it lawful  
          <lb ed="#S" n="48"/>to make any other the author of ma 
          <lb ed="#S" n="49"/>trimonie, than God himselfe. God did  
          <lb ed="#S" n="50"/>by the meane and ministery of his An 
          <lb ed="#S" n="51"/>gels and chosen men, appoint other  
          <lb ed="#S" n="52"/>good and necessarie ordinaunces for  
          <lb ed="#S" n="53"/>mankinds commoditie, but he himself  
          <lb ed="#S" n="54"/>did immediately without the ministe 
          <lb ed="#S" n="55"/>rie of any person ordeine matrimonie,  
          <lb ed="#S" n="56"/>he himselfe did establish and ratifie it  
          <lb ed="#S" n="57"/>with lawes for the purpose, he himself  
          <lb ed="#S" n="58"/>did couple the first married folkes, and  
          <lb ed="#S" n="59"/>hee being the true high priest in deede,  
          <lb ed="#S" n="60"/>did himselfe blesse the couple then,  
          <lb ed="#S" n="61"/>whom hee did joyne together.  
          <lb ed="#S" n="62"/>By this wee may easilie gather the  
          <lb ed="#S" n="63"/>excellent dignitie of marriage or ma 
          <lb ed="#S" n="64"/>trimonie. For God did ordeine it, yea  
          <lb ed="#S" n="65"/>he ordeined it in Paradise, when man  
          <lb ed="#S" n="66"/>as yet was free from all kinde of cala 
          <lb ed="#S" n="67"/>mities. Adam when hee was in the  
          <lb ed="#S" n="68"/>great felicitie of Paradise, seemed not  
          <lb ed="#S" n="69"/>yet to live commodiously nor sweetely  
          <lb ed="#S" n="70"/>enough, except a wife were given to  
          <lb ed="#S" n="71"/>be joyned unto him. It is not good  
          <lb ed="#S" n="72"/>(sayth God) for man to be alone, I will  
          <lb ed="#S" n="73"/>make him a helper to tarie or dwell  
          <lb ed="#S" n="74"/>with him. For God brought to Adam  
          <lb ed="#S" n="75"/>al living creatures which he had crea 
          <lb ed="#S" n="76"/>ted for him to name them: but among  
          <lb ed="#S" n="77"/>them all, there was nothing that A 
          <lb ed="#S" n="78"/>dam had lust unto, his minde and na 
          <lb ed="#S" n="79"/>ture did utterly abhore to be coupled  
          <lb ed="#S" n="80"/>with any of them. God therefore ca

          <cb ed="#L" n="a"/>
          <lb ed="#S" n="1"/>sting Adam into a dead sleepe, doeth  
          <lb ed="#S" n="2"/>out of his side as hee slept, frame uppe  
          <lb ed="#S" n="3"/>a woman, which so soone as Adam set  
          <lb ed="#S" n="4"/>his eye uppon when she was brought  
          <lb ed="#S" n="5"/>unto him by God who had made her,  
          <lb ed="#S" n="6"/>hee straightway crieth that this was  
          <lb ed="#S" n="7"/>such a one as he desired, that this was  
          <lb ed="#S" n="8"/>such a one as he could love, and wher 
          <lb ed="#S" n="9"/>with his nature could verie well a 
          <lb ed="#S" n="10"/>gree. This nowe (saith he) is bone of  
          <lb ed="#S" n="11"/>my bones, and flesh of my flesh. I  
          <lb ed="#S" n="12"/>have found (saith he) I have found an  
          <lb ed="#S" n="13"/>helpe fitte for mee, which hath part of  
          <lb ed="#S" n="14"/>my flesh, of my bloud, and my verie  
          <lb ed="#S" n="15"/>substance. From hence riseth and yet  
          <lb ed="#S" n="16"/>remayneth that naturall pronenesse  
          <lb ed="#S" n="17"/>of men toward woman: when on the  
          <lb ed="#S" n="18"/>otherside overthwart mingling and  
          <lb ed="#S" n="19"/>medling of cursed men with beastes  
          <lb ed="#S" n="20"/>contrarie to mans nature was long  
          <lb ed="#S" n="21"/>agoe destroyed by fire, which shewed  
          <lb ed="#S" n="22"/>that God did abhore it. The Lorde  
          <lb ed="#S" n="23"/>moreover sayde: A man shall forsake  
          <lb ed="#S" n="24"/>his father and his mother, and cleave  
          <lb ed="#S" n="25"/>to his wife, and two shall be one flesh  
          <lb ed="#S" n="26"/>But in the exposition of the fifth com 
          <lb ed="#S" n="27"/>maundment we perceived how much  
          <lb ed="#S" n="28"/>God doth set by the love and goodwill  
          <lb ed="#S" n="29"/>of children to their parentes, and what  
          <lb ed="#S" n="30"/>a charge he giveth to children to ho 
          <lb ed="#S" n="31"/>nour them. It must needes be there 
          <lb ed="#S" n="32"/>fore that wedlocke is a most heavenly  
          <lb ed="#S" n="33"/>ordinaunce, since it is preferred be 
          <lb ed="#S" n="34"/>fore the honouring of parentes: and  
          <lb ed="#S" n="35"/>yet neverthelesse it is so preferred, as  
          <lb ed="#S" n="36"/>that by the law of matrimonie, the  
          <lb ed="#S" n="37"/>precept for the honour due to parents  
          <lb ed="#S" n="38"/>may not be abolished, but that there 
          <lb ed="#S" n="39"/>by married folkes may knowe to be 
          <lb ed="#S" n="40"/>have themselves so, if their parentes  
          <lb ed="#S" n="41"/>goe about to breede discorde betwixt  
          <lb ed="#S" n="42"/>them and their spouses, that then they  
          <lb ed="#S" n="43"/>suffer not themselmes for their pa 
          <lb ed="#S" n="44"/>rentes wordes to be severed, but in  
          <lb ed="#S" n="45"/>all things else to honour them as they  
          <lb ed="#S" n="46"/>should. The holy Patriarches kept

          <lb ed="#S" n="47"/>the lawe of matrimonie, and reveren 
          <lb ed="#S" n="48"/>ced wedlocke verie devoutely. For no  
          <lb ed="#S" n="49"/>small parcell of the first and most ex 
          <lb ed="#S" n="50"/>cellent booke of the Bible called Ge 
          <lb ed="#S" n="51"/>nesis, is spent in rehearsing the mar 
          <lb ed="#S" n="52"/>riages of holie men. Neyther is Mo 
          <lb ed="#S" n="53"/>ses the peerelesse servant of God a 
          <lb ed="#S" n="54"/>shamed to make mention of the busi 
          <lb ed="#S" n="55"/>nes and workes of wedlocke as pure  
          <lb ed="#S" n="56"/>and excellent, which seeme to many  
          <lb ed="#S" n="57"/>at this day to be foule and filthie.  
          <lb ed="#S" n="58"/>Christ himselfe (who being the verie  
          <lb ed="#S" n="59"/>naturall sonne of God, was himselfe  
          <lb ed="#S" n="60"/>borne in wedlocke although of a pure  
          <lb ed="#S" n="61"/>and uncorupted Virgine) did honour  
          <lb ed="#S" n="62"/>and commend the knotte of matrimo 
          <lb ed="#S" n="63"/>nie, while hee did vouchsafe to shewe 
          <lb ed="#S" n="64"/>his first miracle at a wedding, which  
          <lb ed="#S" n="65"/>was such a myracle as did declare  
          <lb ed="#S" n="66"/>that the Lorde is able to make the bit 
          <lb ed="#S" n="67"/>ternesse of marriage sweete, and the  
          <lb ed="#S" n="68"/>scarcitie thereof to abound with plen 
          <lb ed="#S" n="69"/>tie. As the Apostles were married  
          <lb ed="#S" n="70"/>men according to the examples of the  
          <lb ed="#S" n="71"/>patriarches, kinges, princes, priestes,  
          <lb ed="#S" n="72"/>and prophetes: So Paul the chiefe of  
          <lb ed="#S" n="73"/>all the Apostles, cryeth out and saith:  
          <lb ed="#S" n="74"/>Wedlocke is honourable among all,  
          <lb ed="#S" n="75"/>and the bedde undefiled. But whore 
          <lb ed="#S" n="76"/>mongers and adulterers God will  
          <lb ed="#S" n="77"/>judge. He sayeth taht wedlocke is ho 
          <lb ed="#S" n="78"/>nourable among all, he meaneth, all  
          <lb ed="#S" n="79"/>nations: For verie fewe people shall  
          <lb ed="#S" n="80"/>you find that do not greatly commend  
          <lb ed="#S" n="81"/>the state of marriage. Xenophon thin 
          <lb ed="#S" n="82"/>keth taht among all Gods ordinaun 
          <lb ed="#S" n="83"/>ces scant anie one can be found that is  
          <lb ed="#S" n="84"/>more commendable or profitable than  
          <lb ed="#S" n="85"/>wedlocke is. Musonius, Hierocles,  
          <lb ed="#S" n="86"/>and other auncient sages thinke mar 
          <lb ed="#S" n="87"/>riage to bee so necessarie to live well  
          <lb ed="#S" n="88"/>and conveniently, that the life of man  
          <lb ed="#S" n="89"/>without marriage seemeth to be may 
          <lb ed="#S" n="90"/>med. Even they (ye heathens I meane)  
          <lb ed="#S" n="91"/>doe make the evils and discommodi 
          <lb ed="#S" n="92"/>ties of marriage to consist in ye married

          <cb ed="#L" n="a"/>
          <lb ed="#S" n="1"/>folkes and not in mariage. For mar 
          <lb ed="#S" n="2"/>riage of it selfe is good, but many use  
          <lb ed="#S" n="3"/>not well the thing that is good, and  
          <lb ed="#S" n="4"/>therefore they feele the smart of their  
          <lb ed="#S" n="5"/>soule abuse worthily. For who kno 
          <lb ed="#S" n="6"/>weth not that the faulte of drunken 
          <lb ed="#S" n="7"/>nesse is not to bee referred to wine  
          <lb ed="#S" n="8"/>which is the good and holesome crea 
          <lb ed="#S" n="9"/>ture of God, but to the excessive bib 
          <lb ed="#S" n="10"/>bing and ever great greedinesse of ma  
          <lb ed="#S" n="11"/>which abuseth Gods good creature? 
          <lb ed="#S" n="12"/>That which commeth out of the heart  
          <lb ed="#S" n="13"/>of man (saith the Lorde in the Gospel)  
          <lb ed="#S" n="14"/>and not that which goeth in by the  
          <lb ed="#S" n="15"/>mouth, defileth the man. Hereunto  
          <lb ed="#S" n="16"/>belongth that saying of Paul the A 
          <lb ed="#S" n="17"/>postle of Christ, where he attributeth  
          <lb ed="#S" n="18"/>sanctification to wedlocke: for the bed  
          <lb ed="#S" n="19"/>(saith he) is undefiled: and in an other  
          <lb ed="#S" n="20"/>place he testifieth that the unbeleeving  
          <lb ed="#S" n="21"/>husband is sanctified by the beleeving  
          <lb ed="#S" n="22"/>wife: hee affirmeth also that children  
          <lb ed="#S" n="23"/>borne in wedlocke are holy or cleane.  
          <lb ed="#S" n="24"/>Moreover the same Paul maketh  
          <lb ed="#S" n="25"/>Christ an example of love betwixt ma  
          <lb ed="#S" n="26"/>and wife: and shadoweth ye mysteries  
          <lb ed="#S" n="27"/>of Christ and the Church by the colour  
          <lb ed="#S" n="28"/>of wedlocke: he figureth (I say) a hea 
          <lb ed="#S" n="29"/>venly thing by an holy type taht God  
          <lb ed="#S" n="30"/>doth allowe. Whereuppon in an other  
          <lb ed="#S" n="31"/>place the same Apostle doth say: That  
          <lb ed="#S" n="32"/>their doctrine is a verie doctrine of  
          <lb ed="#S" n="33"/>devils which forbid men to marie.  
          <lb ed="#S" n="34"/>And so consequently it followeth that  
          <lb ed="#S" n="35"/>that is an heavely doctrine proceeding  
          <lb ed="#S" n="36"/>from God, which permitteth mariage

          <lb ed="#S" n="47"/>men: and therefore it followeth that  
          <lb ed="#S" n="48"/>hee ordeyned matrimonie for the pre 
          <lb ed="#S" n="49"/>servation of mankind to the ende that  
          <lb ed="#S" n="50"/>mans life might be pleasaunt, sweets  
          <lb ed="#S" n="51"/>and throughly furnished with joyes  
          <lb ed="#S" n="52"/>sufficient. But al these causes may bee  
          <lb ed="#S" n="53"/>reduced into ye number of three. First  
          <lb ed="#S" n="54"/>God himselfe doth say: It is not good  
          <lb ed="#S" n="55"/>for man to be alone, let us make him  
          <lb ed="#S" n="56"/>an helpe therefore to bee before him,  
          <lb ed="#S" n="57"/>or to dwell with him. So then the first  
          <lb ed="#S" n="58"/>cause why wedlocke was instituted,  
          <lb ed="#S" n="59"/>is mans commoditie, that thereby the  
          <lb ed="#S" n="60"/>life of man might bee the pleasaunter  
          <lb ed="#S" n="61"/>and more comodious. For Adam see 
          <lb ed="#S" n="62"/>med not to live halfe happilie nor  
          <lb ed="#S" n="63"/>sweetely enough, unlesse he had a wife  
          <lb ed="#S" n="64"/>to joyne himsefe unto: which wife is  
          <lb ed="#S" n="65"/>not in the Scriptures called an impe 
          <lb ed="#S" n="66"/>diment or necessarie evill, as certaine  
          <lb ed="#S" n="67"/>Poets and beastly men, who hated  
          <lb ed="#S" n="68"/>women, have foolishly langled, but she  
          <lb ed="#S" n="69"/>is the helpe or arme of the man. An 
          <lb ed="#S" n="70"/>tipater an heathen writer In Sermone  
          <lb ed="#S" n="71"/>de Nuptys, doeth wonderfully agree  
          <lb ed="#S" n="72"/>with this saying of the scripture, and  
          <lb ed="#S" n="73"/>expresseth plainly what kinde of helpe  
          <lb ed="#S" n="74"/>and what manner of arme the wife is  
          <lb ed="#S" n="75"/>to her husband. Whosoever, sayth he  
          <lb ed="#S" n="76"/>hath not had triall of wyfe and chil 
          <lb ed="#S" n="77"/>dren, hee is utterly ignoraunt of true  
          <lb ed="#S" n="78"/>mutuall goodwill. Love in wedlocke  
          <lb ed="#S" n="79"/>is mutually shewed, when man and  
          <lb ed="#S" n="80"/>wife doe not comunicate wealth, chil 
          <lb ed="#S" n="81"/>dren, and heartes also, as friendes are  
          <lb ed="#S" n="82"/>wont to doe, but have their bodies in  
          <lb ed="#S" n="83"/>comon also, which friends cannot do.  
          <lb ed="#S" n="84"/>And therefore Euripides laying aside  
          <lb ed="#S" n="85"/>the deadly hate that he bare to wome,  
          <lb ed="#S" n="86"/>writ these verses in commendation of  
          <lb ed="#S" n="87"/>marriage.  
          <lb ed="#S" n="88"/>The wife that gads not gigglot wife  
          <lb ed="#S" n="89"/>with everie flirting gill,  
          <lb ed="#S" n="90"/>Bul honestly doth keepe at home,

          <lb ed="#S" n="47"/>housholde affaires: but when we have  
          <lb ed="#S" n="48"/>dispatched them, and are once retur 
          <lb ed="#S" n="49"/>ned to our wives at home, so that our  
          <lb ed="#S" n="50"/>minds are at quiet, and we restored to  
          <lb ed="#S" n="51"/>our ease and libertie, then are our com 
          <lb ed="#S" n="52"/>bersome businesses well lightened, and  
          <lb ed="#S" n="53"/>eased, whereby they cease to trouble  
          <lb ed="#S" n="54"/>us any longer. Neither is a wife trou 
          <lb ed="#S" n="55"/>blesome undoubtedly, but lighteneth  
          <lb ed="#S" n="56"/>things that are troublesome to us. For  
          <lb ed="#S" n="57"/>there is nothing so heavie, that a man  
          <lb ed="#S" n="58"/>and wife living is concorde are not a 
          <lb ed="#S" n="59"/>ble to beare, especially if they be both  
          <lb ed="#S" n="60"/>willing to doe their indeavour. And so  
          <lb ed="#S" n="61"/>foorth.  
          <lb ed="#S" n="62"/>the second cause why Matrimony  
          <lb ed="#S" n="63"/>was ordayned, is the begetting of chil 
          <lb ed="#S" n="64"/>dren for the preservation of mankinde  
          <lb ed="#S" n="65"/>by increase, and the bringing of them  
          <lb ed="#S" n="66"/>uppe in the feare of the Lord. For the  
          <lb ed="#S" n="67"/>Lorde blessed Adam and Eva, saying:  
          <lb ed="#S" n="68"/>Increase and multiplie, and replenish  
          <lb ed="#S" n="69"/>the earth. Paul the Apostle in his E 
          <lb ed="#S" n="70"/>pistle to Titus saith: Speake to the el 
          <lb ed="#S" n="71"/>der women that they may teach honest thinges, that they may teach ho 
          <lb ed="#S" n="72"/>nest thinges, that they may make the  
          <lb ed="#S" n="73"/>younger women to be sober minded,  
          <lb ed="#S" n="74"/>to love their husbandes, to love their  
          <lb ed="#S" n="75"/>children, to bee discreete housekee 
          <lb ed="#S" n="76"/>pers, good, obedient to their hus 
          <lb ed="#S" n="77"/>bandes. And againe to Timothie: A 
          <lb ed="#S" n="78"/>dam was not deceived, but the wo 
          <lb ed="#S" n="79"/>man was seduced, notwithstanding  
          <lb ed="#S" n="80"/>through bearing of children she shall  
          <lb ed="#S" n="81"/>bee saved, if they continue in faith,  
          <lb ed="#S" n="82"/>and charitie, and holinesse with mode 
          <lb ed="#S" n="83"/>stie. But the begetting of children  
          <lb ed="#S" n="84"/>were altogether unprofitable, if they  
          <lb ed="#S" n="85"/>were not well brought up. For the  
          <lb ed="#S" n="86"/>that loveth her children in deede, doth  
          <lb ed="#S" n="87"/>bring them up in ye feare of the Lorde.  
          <lb ed="#S" n="88"/>Which bringing up is no small com 
          <lb ed="#S" n="89"/>moditie to ye common weale &amp; Church  
          <lb ed="#S" n="90"/>of God. The glorie also and worship  
          <lb ed="#S" n="91"/>of God, is greatly augmented, when

          <lb ed="#S" n="1"/>as by wedlocke there doth spring up a  
          <lb ed="#S" n="2"/>great number of men ye acknowledge,  
          <lb ed="#S" n="3"/>call upon, &amp; worship god as they ought  
          <lb ed="#S" n="4"/>to doe. The thirde cause why matri 
          <lb ed="#S" n="5"/>monie was ordeined, ye Apostle Paule  
          <lb ed="#S" n="6"/>expresseth in these wordes: To avoide  
          <lb ed="#S" n="7"/>whoredome let everie man have his  
          <lb ed="#S" n="8"/>owne wife, and every woman her own  
          <lb ed="#S" n="9"/>husband. It were good and expedient  
          <lb ed="#S" n="10"/>for a man not to touch a woman, and  
          <lb ed="#S" n="11"/>to live single, but because this is not  
          <lb ed="#S" n="12"/>given to all men, as ye Lord in the Gos 
          <lb ed="#S" n="13"/>pell testifieth, &amp; that concupiscence of  
          <lb ed="#S" n="14"/>the flesh doeth for the most part, burne  
          <lb ed="#S" n="15"/>the greatest sort of men, the Lord hath  
          <lb ed="#S" n="16"/>appointed marriage to be as it were a  
          <lb ed="#S" n="17"/>remedie against that heate, as the A 
          <lb ed="#S" n="18"/>postle in another place witnesseth, say 
          <lb ed="#S" n="19"/>ing: Let them marry which cannot ab 
          <lb ed="#S" n="20"/>staine: for it is better to marrie than to  
          <lb ed="#S" n="21"/>burne. By this we learne that the na 
          <lb ed="#S" n="22"/>turall copanie of a man with his own  
          <lb ed="#S" n="23"/>wife, is not reputed for a fault or un 
          <lb ed="#S" n="24"/>cleannesse in the fight of God. Whore 
          <lb ed="#S" n="25"/>dome is uncleannesse in the eies of the  
          <lb ed="#S" n="26"/>Lord, because it is directly contrary to  
          <lb ed="#S" n="27"/>the lawe of God. But God hath allow 
          <lb ed="#S" n="28"/>ed wedlocke and blessed it, therefore  
          <lb ed="#S" n="29"/>married folkes are sanctified by ye bles 
          <lb ed="#S" n="30"/>sing of God through faith and obedi

          <lb ed="#S" n="32"/>dent argumentes, and testimonies of  
          <lb ed="#S" n="33"/>Paule to prove it by. For to the He 
          <lb ed="#S" n="34"/>brewes he saide: Wedlocke is honor 
          <lb ed="#S" n="35"/>able among al men, and teh bed undefi 
          <lb ed="#S" n="36"/>led: but whoremonders and adulte 
          <lb ed="#S" n="37"/>rers God will judge. the Apostle here  
          <lb ed="#S" n="38"/>spake verie reverently, and by the bed  
          <lb ed="#S" n="39"/>he understood the naturall company of  
          <lb ed="#S" n="40"/>a man with his wife, which he saieth  
          <lb ed="#S" n="41"/>plainely is undefiled. What God hath

          <lb ed="#S" n="47"/>openly: That the lying of a man with his  
          <lb ed="#S" n="48"/>owne wife is chastitie. Neither was  
          <lb ed="#S" n="49"/>the most modest Apostle ashamed to  
          <lb ed="#S" n="50"/>make lawes betwixt a ma &amp; his wife.  
          <lb ed="#S" n="51"/>For to the Corinthians he saith, Let  
          <lb ed="#S" n="52"/>the husband give to the wife due bene 
          <lb ed="#S" n="53"/>volence: likewise also the wife to the  
          <lb ed="#S" n="54"/>husband. The wife hath not the power  
          <lb ed="#S" n="55"/>of her owne bodie, but the husbande:  
          <lb ed="#S" n="56"/>likewise also the husband hath not the  
          <lb ed="#S" n="57"/>power of his owne bodie, but the wife.  
          <lb ed="#S" n="58"/>Defraude ye not the one the other, ex 
          <lb ed="#S" n="59"/>cept it be with both your consents for  
          <lb ed="#S" n="60"/>a time, that ye may give your selves to  
          <lb ed="#S" n="61"/>fasting and to prayer: and afterwarde  
          <lb ed="#S" n="62"/>come together againe, that fathan tept  
          <lb ed="#S" n="63"/>you not for your incontinencie. These  
          <lb ed="#S" n="64"/>words of ye Apostle are so evident, that  
          <lb ed="#S" n="65"/>they neede no exposition at all. In the  
          <lb ed="#S" n="66"/>same Epistle againe he saith: If thou  
          <lb ed="#S" n="67"/>marriest a wife, thou sinnest not. And  
          <lb ed="#S" n="68"/>againe, If a virgine marry, she hath not  
          <lb ed="#S" n="69"/>sinned. Now what is more excellent,  
          <lb ed="#S" n="70"/>pure and holy, than virginitie is? But  
          <lb ed="#S" n="71"/>a virgine sinneth not if the change vir 
          <lb ed="#S" n="72"/>ginitie for holy matrimonie. Very wel  
          <lb ed="#S" n="73"/>therefore doeth Chrysostome in a cer

          <lb ed="#S" n="76"/>is faithfull wedlocke. S. Augustine also  
          <lb ed="#S" n="77"/>calleth marriage chastity or cotinency:  
          <lb ed="#S" n="78"/>the place is to be seene in the 19. and 20.

          <lb ed="#S" n="81"/>spring ye greatest part of publique ho 
          <lb ed="#S" n="82"/>nestie. For God alloweth wedlock, but  
          <lb ed="#S" n="83"/>disalloweth fornication and all kind of  
          <lb ed="#S" n="84"/>uncleannes. It pleased him by his or

          <pb ed="#L" n="227"/>
          <cb ed="#L" n="a"/>
          <lb ed="#S" n="1"/>what largely out of the holy scripture,  
          <lb ed="#S" n="2"/>to the intent I might prove to al men,  
          <lb ed="#S" n="3"/>that wedlocke is holie, &amp; that therefore  
          <lb ed="#S" n="4"/>no ma can be defiled with ye moderate,  
          <lb ed="#S" n="5"/>holie, &amp; lawful use thereof: and so con 
          <lb ed="#S" n="6"/>sequently that marriage is permitted  
          <lb ed="#S" n="7"/>to al sorts of men. For ye Apostle saith:  
          <lb ed="#S" n="8"/>Let a bishoppe be the husband of one  
          <lb ed="#S" n="9"/>wife, let him rule his owne house wel,  
          <lb ed="#S" n="10"/>and have faithfull children. For it is  
          <lb ed="#S" n="11"/>manifest by ye testimonies of scripture  
          <lb ed="#S" n="12"/>and ecclesiasticall writers, that the A 
          <lb ed="#S" n="13"/>postles of Christ and other Apostolical  
          <lb ed="#S" n="14"/>teachers of ye primitive Church were  
          <lb ed="#S" n="15"/>married men, and had wives and chil 
          <lb ed="#S" n="16"/>dren. Neither is there any thing, next  
          <lb ed="#S" n="17"/>after corrupt doctrine, which doeth  
          <lb ed="#S" n="18"/>more infect the Church of Christ, and  
          <lb ed="#S" n="19"/>subvert al ecclesiastical discipline, than  
          <lb ed="#S" n="20"/>if the ministers of teh churches, which  
          <lb ed="#S" n="21"/>should be lights of the whole congre 
          <lb ed="#S" n="22"/>gation, be fornicators or adulterous  
          <lb ed="#S" n="23"/>persons. That offence especially above  
          <lb ed="#S" n="24"/>all other, is an hinderaunce and blot to  
          <lb ed="#S" n="25"/>al kind of honesty: but touching this I  
          <lb ed="#S" n="26"/>purpose not at this time to discourse so  
          <lb ed="#S" n="27"/>largely and fully as I might. to this  
          <lb ed="#S" n="28"/>I adde, ye the band of wedlock is indis 
          <lb ed="#S" n="29"/>soluble &amp; everlasting, ye is to say, such a  
          <lb ed="#S" n="30"/>knot as never can be undone. For of  
          <lb ed="#S" n="31"/>fire is made one flesh and one bodye,  
          <lb ed="#S" n="32"/>which if you sever, you do utterly mar  
          <lb ed="#S" n="33"/>it. What God hath joyned together  
          <lb ed="#S" n="34"/>therefore, let not ma separat. They ther 
          <lb ed="#S" n="35"/>fore do make a slauhhter of this bodye,  
          <lb ed="#S" n="36"/>that do comit adulterie. For ye lawes  
          <lb ed="#S" n="37"/>of God and men admit a divorcement  
          <lb ed="#S" n="38"/>betwixt a man &amp; his adulterous wife.  
          <lb ed="#S" n="39"/>And yet let not anye lesse or lighter  
          <lb ed="#S" n="40"/>cause dissolve this knot betwixt man  
          <lb ed="#S" n="41"/>and wife, than fornication is. Other 
          <lb ed="#S" n="42"/>wise God which in the Gospell hath  
          <lb ed="#S" n="43"/>permitted the lesse, doth not forbid the  
          <lb ed="#S" n="44"/>greater to bee causes of divorcement.  
          <lb ed="#S" n="45"/>And in the primitive church the Epi 
          <lb ed="#S" n="46"/>stles &amp; costitutions of christian princes  
          <!--227.xml-->
          <pb ed="#L" n="227"/>
          <cb ed="#L" n="b"/>
          <lb ed="#S" n="47"/>do testifie, ye once comiting of fornicati 
          <lb ed="#S" n="48"/>on was no cause of divorcement. Of  
          <lb ed="#S" n="49"/>which I have spoken in another place.  
          <lb ed="#S" n="50"/>But that this holy knot may be the  
          <lb ed="#S" n="51"/>surer, it is availeable that marriages  
          <lb ed="#S" n="52"/>be made holily, lawfully, and with dis 
          <lb ed="#S" n="53"/>cretion in the feare of the Lorde. Let  
          <lb ed="#S" n="54"/>them not be unwilling agreed unto  
          <lb ed="#S" n="55"/>and made up by compulsio. First let ye  
          <lb ed="#S" n="56"/>good liking of their consenting mindes  
          <lb ed="#S" n="57"/>bee joyned in one, whom the open pro 
          <lb ed="#S" n="58"/>session of natural consent &amp; outwarde  
          <lb ed="#S" n="59"/>hand-fasting must afterwarde couple  
          <lb ed="#S" n="60"/>together. Let the be matched together,  
          <lb ed="#S" n="61"/>that are not severed by alliaunce of  
          <lb ed="#S" n="62"/>bloud, and nighnesse of affinitie. Let  
          <lb ed="#S" n="63"/>them be coupled in one, that may ma 
          <lb ed="#S" n="64"/>rie together by the lawes of God and  
          <lb ed="#S" n="65"/>their coutrie, with the consent &amp; coun 
          <lb ed="#S" n="66"/>sel of their friends &amp; parents. Let them  
          <lb ed="#S" n="67"/>which minde marriage have a sincere  
          <lb ed="#S" n="68"/>heart purposely bent to seek their own  
          <lb ed="#S" n="69"/>safegard &amp; continuall felicitie, that is,  
          <lb ed="#S" n="70"/>to respect only the wil and pleasure of  
          <lb ed="#S" n="71"/>God, and not admit anie evil affectios  
          <lb ed="#S" n="72"/>as counsellers to make up ye marriage  
          <lb ed="#S" n="73"/>betwixt them. Hierocles in his booke  
          <lb ed="#S" n="74"/>De nuptys saith: It is meere follie and  
          <lb ed="#S" n="75"/>lacke of wit which make those things  
          <lb ed="#S" n="76"/>that of theselves are easie to be borne,  
          <lb ed="#S" n="77"/>troublesome, and make a wife a gri 
          <lb ed="#S" n="78"/>nous clog to her husband. For marri 
          <lb ed="#S" n="79"/>age to many me hath bin intollerable:  
          <lb ed="#S" n="80"/>not because the wedded state is by de 
          <lb ed="#S" n="81"/>fault of it selfe or owne proper nature  
          <lb ed="#S" n="82"/>so troublesome or comberous, but  
          <lb ed="#S" n="83"/>for our matching as we shoulde not,  
          <lb ed="#S" n="84"/>it falleth out as wee woulde not, and  
          <lb ed="#S" n="85"/>causeth our marriages to bee grievous  
          <lb ed="#S" n="86"/>and noysome. To this ende verily our  
          <lb ed="#S" n="87"/>daily marriages doe commonly come.  
          <lb ed="#S" n="88"/>For they marrie wives usually not  
          <lb ed="#S" n="89"/>for the begetting of children or so 
          <lb ed="#S" n="90"/>cietie of life: but some for a greate  
          <lb ed="#S" n="91"/>dowrie, some for a beautifull bodye,  
          <lb ed="#S" n="92"/>and some beeing seduced by suche

          <cb ed="#L" n="a"/>
          <lb ed="#S" n="1"/>kinde of causes, as it were men abused  
          <lb ed="#S" n="2"/>by unfaithfull counsellers, have no re 
          <lb ed="#S" n="3"/>garde to the disposition and maners of  
          <lb ed="#S" n="4"/>their spouse, but marrie at adventures  
          <lb ed="#S" n="5"/>to their owne decay, and utter destru 
          <lb ed="#S" n="6"/>ction. Hereunto belongeth Plutarchs  
          <lb ed="#S" n="7"/>admonition to parents in his treatise  
          <lb ed="#S" n="8"/>of bringing uppe of children, where  
          <lb ed="#S" n="9"/>hee conselleth men to bestowe suche  
          <lb ed="#S" n="10"/>wives on their sons as are not muche  
          <lb ed="#S" n="11"/>wealthier nor mightier, than their  
          <lb ed="#S" n="12"/>children. For a very pithy saying is  
          <lb ed="#S" n="13"/>that usuall Proverbe: Marrie a wife  
          <lb ed="#S" n="14"/>of thine owne degree. To be short, let  
          <lb ed="#S" n="15"/>the feare of God, the word of God, and  
          <lb ed="#S" n="16"/>earnest prayer powred out to God, bee  
          <lb ed="#S" n="17"/>alwayes annexed to the beginning of  
          <lb ed="#S" n="18"/>marriages.  
          <lb ed="#S" n="19"/>But it is not convenient, that in  
          <lb ed="#S" n="20"/>lawfull matrimonie, any more should  
          <lb ed="#S" n="21"/>bee than two alone, to bee joyned toge 
          <lb ed="#S" n="22"/>ther under one yoke of wedlocke. For  
          <lb ed="#S" n="23"/>the use of many wives which our fa 
          <lb ed="#S" n="24"/>thers usurped without anye blame,  
          <lb ed="#S" n="25"/>may not establish Polygamie for a law  
          <lb ed="#S" n="26"/>among us at these dayes. The time  
          <lb ed="#S" n="27"/>of correction is now come to light, and  
          <lb ed="#S" n="28"/>Messias nowe is corne into the worlde,  
          <lb ed="#S" n="29"/>who teacheth all rightly, and refour 
          <lb ed="#S" n="30"/>meth things amisse. hee therefore hath  
          <lb ed="#S" n="31"/>reduced wedlocke to the first prescri 
          <lb ed="#S" n="32"/>bed rule and law of matrimonie. Two   
          <lb ed="#S" n="33"/>(saith the Lord) shal be one flesh. And  
          <lb ed="#S" n="34"/>the Apostle saith, Let every man have  
          <lb ed="#S" n="35"/>his owne wife, and every woman her  
          <lb ed="#S" n="36"/>owne husbande. The multitude of  
          <lb ed="#S" n="37"/>Salomons concubines thereofre apper 
          <lb ed="#S" n="38"/>tayne not to us. Wee have not to fol 
          <lb ed="#S" n="39"/>low the example of Jacob, who mar 
          <lb ed="#S" n="40"/>ried two sisters. And yet notwithstan 
          <lb ed="#S" n="41"/>ding the worde of trueth condemmeth  
          <lb ed="#S" n="42"/>not the second, third, or mary marria 
          <lb ed="#S" n="43"/>ges, which a man maketh when his  
          <lb ed="#S" n="44"/>wife is deceased. For that saying of the  
          <lb ed="#S" n="45"/>Apostle is general to al men, and indu 
          <lb ed="#S" n="46"/>reth in all ages: Let them marry that

          <pb ed="#L" n="228"/>
          <cb ed="#L" n="b"/>
          <lb ed="#S" n="47"/>cannot abstaine, for it is better to mar 
          <lb ed="#S" n="48"/>rie than to burne. Which sentence is  
          <lb ed="#S" n="49"/>faken out of these words in the gospel:   
          <lb ed="#S" n="50"/>All men can not receive this saying,  
          <lb ed="#S" n="51"/>save they to whom it is give. For there  
          <lb ed="#S" n="52"/>are some chaste which were so borne  
          <lb ed="#S" n="53"/>out of their monthes womb: and there  
          <lb ed="#S" n="54"/>are some chaste which were made  
          <lb ed="#S" n="55"/>chaste of men: &amp; there are some chast  
          <lb ed="#S" n="56"/>which have made themselves chaste  
          <lb ed="#S" n="57"/>for the kingdome of heavens sake. He  
          <lb ed="#S" n="58"/>that is able to receive it, let him re 
          <lb ed="#S" n="59"/>ceive it. Let him therefore that cannot  
          <lb ed="#S" n="60"/>receive it, marry a wife, so often as ne 
          <lb ed="#S" n="61"/>cessitie compelleth hint thereunto.  
          <lb ed="#S" n="62"/>But now especially it standeth us  
          <lb ed="#S" n="63"/>in hand to know howe married folkes  
          <lb ed="#S" n="64"/>must behave themselves, what they  
          <lb ed="#S" n="65"/>must doe in wedlock, to what end they  
          <lb ed="#S" n="66"/>must direct their deedes and thoughts,  
          <lb ed="#S" n="67"/>and how they ought to bee affected to 
          <lb ed="#S" n="68"/>ward that holy ordinaunce of God al 
          <lb ed="#S" n="69"/>mightie. Touching which thing I wil  
          <lb ed="#S" n="70"/>not speake much, but briefly note out  
          <lb ed="#S" n="71"/>the most necessarie pointes, to give all  
          <lb ed="#S" n="72"/>men occasion to think with theselves,  
          <lb ed="#S" n="73"/>and call to minde both more and grea 
          <lb ed="#S" n="74"/>ter matters which I leave untouched.  
          <lb ed="#S" n="75"/>First of all let married folkes bee  
          <lb ed="#S" n="76"/>throughly perswaded and assuredly  
          <lb ed="#S" n="77"/>certayne, while they live in matri 
          <lb ed="#S" n="78"/>monie, that they are in the woorke of  
          <lb ed="#S" n="79"/>God, that they please God, and do an  
          <lb ed="#S" n="80"/>acceptable thing in the fight of ye Lord,  
          <lb ed="#S" n="81"/>because of Gods word wherein he bles 
          <lb ed="#S" n="82"/>sed that kinde of life, and sanctified all  
          <lb ed="#S" n="83"/>wedded people, which by faith do live  
          <lb ed="#S" n="84"/>in that woorke and ordinaunce of the  
          <lb ed="#S" n="85"/>living God. Therefore when married  
          <lb ed="#S" n="86"/>couples doe patiently suffer the trou 
          <lb ed="#S" n="87"/>bles, that followe the married life,  
          <lb ed="#S" n="88"/>while they labour faithfully, while  
          <lb ed="#S" n="89"/>they doe those thinges decently which  
          <lb ed="#S" n="90"/>belong to the charge and office of  
          <lb ed="#S" n="91"/>marryed people, as while the wife  
          <lb ed="#S" n="92"/>doth love her husband, while shee doth  
          <!--229.xml-->
          <pb ed="#L" n="229"/>
          <cb ed="#L" n="a"/>
          <lb ed="#S" n="1"/>duetifully obey him, while shee doeth  
          <lb ed="#S" n="2"/>bring foorth her children with griefe &amp;  
          <lb ed="#S" n="3"/>paine, &amp; when they are brought foorth,  
          <lb ed="#S" n="4"/>doeth diligently nourish them, and la 
          <lb ed="#S" n="5"/>bour to bring them up: while the hus 
          <lb ed="#S" n="6"/>band doth love his wife, while he doth  
          <lb ed="#S" n="7"/>mutually helpe her, and faithfully in  
          <lb ed="#S" n="8"/>all things shew himselfe a careful fa 
          <lb ed="#S" n="9"/>ther for his family and housholde: in  
          <lb ed="#S" n="10"/>doing these things, they please God no  
          <lb ed="#S" n="11"/>lesse, than they doe when they goe to  
          <lb ed="#S" n="12"/>Church to heare the word of God, and  
          <lb ed="#S" n="13"/>to worshippe the Lorde. For these  
          <lb ed="#S" n="14"/>workes of wedlocke are reputed for  
          <lb ed="#S" n="15"/>good works, as wel as giving of almes,  
          <lb ed="#S" n="16"/>justice, and making of peace. Marri 
          <lb ed="#S" n="17"/>ed folkes therfore have neede especial 
          <lb ed="#S" n="18"/>ly of trueu faith in God the Authour of  
          <lb ed="#S" n="19"/>wedlocke. For by wedlocke in faith  
          <lb ed="#S" n="20"/>they shall please the Lorde. This our  
          <lb ed="#S" n="21"/>Monkes could not abide to heare of, al 
          <lb ed="#S" n="22"/>though the word of God doth urge it u 
          <lb ed="#S" n="23"/>pon them, they ceased not to magnifie  
          <lb ed="#S" n="24"/>their counterfeite holinesse and hypo 
          <lb ed="#S" n="25"/>criticall vowes.  
          <lb ed="#S" n="26"/>Secondarily it is required at ye hands  
          <lb ed="#S" n="27"/>of wedded couples to bee mindfull of  
          <lb ed="#S" n="28"/>the faith, which they give and take,  
          <lb ed="#S" n="29"/>that they do not falsely deceive one an 
          <lb ed="#S" n="30"/>other, but holily keepe the promise that  
          <lb ed="#S" n="31"/>they make, and troth that they plight,  
          <lb ed="#S" n="32"/>and to keepe it sincerely both in bodie  
          <lb ed="#S" n="33"/>and mind. Let neyther of them lust af 
          <lb ed="#S" n="34"/>ter the bodie of a straunger, nor con 
          <lb ed="#S" n="35"/>ceieve an hatred or lothsomnes of their  
          <lb ed="#S" n="36"/>wedded spouse. And thy body, thou that  
          <lb ed="#S" n="37"/>art a married man, is not they bodie,  
          <lb ed="#S" n="38"/>but thy wives: as also thy wives body  
          <lb ed="#S" n="39"/>is not thy wives, but thine.  
          <lb ed="#S" n="40"/>Thou stealest and doest commit a  
          <lb ed="#S" n="41"/>robberie, if thou take awaie another  
          <lb ed="#S" n="42"/>bodies goods, and when thou hast con 
          <lb ed="#S" n="43"/>veyed it from the proper owner, doest  
          <lb ed="#S" n="44"/>give it to another. Let the minde of  
          <lb ed="#S" n="45"/>wedded mates be unspotted, and the  
          <lb ed="#S" n="46"/>bodie untouched. Everie one when he

          <lb ed="#S" n="48"/>by ye holy Ceremonie ordeined for that  
          <lb ed="#S" n="49"/>purpose, doth promise with an oath in  
          <lb ed="#S" n="50"/>the name of the Lorde before God and  
          <lb ed="#S" n="51"/>the Church, that hee will use the com

          <lb ed="#S" n="56"/>he is falsely forsworne, and is a brea

          <lb ed="#S" n="59"/>Neyther is it sufficient for thee to

          <lb ed="#S" n="62"/>dwel with her according to knowledg,  
          <lb ed="#S" n="63"/>as S. Peter saith. Let the husbande

          <lb ed="#S" n="75"/>thinke that they twaine are one body,  
          <lb ed="#S" n="76"/>or the members of one bodie. And

          <lb ed="#S" n="83"/>doe rather honour them, lighten their

          <lb ed="#S" n="3"/>twixt man and wife. For to that end  
          <lb ed="#S" n="4"/>the woman was take out of the mans  
          <lb ed="#S" n="5"/>bodie, that the husband should cherish  
          <lb ed="#S" n="6"/>(his wife) his owne bodie. And for that  
          <lb ed="#S" n="7"/>cause the Apostle saith: So must hus 
          <lb ed="#S" n="8"/>bandes love their wives, even as their  
          <lb ed="#S" n="9"/>owne bodies. He that loveth his wife  
          <lb ed="#S" n="10"/>doeth love himselfe. For no man at

          <lb ed="#S" n="12"/>but loveth and cherisheth it, as the

          <lb ed="#S" n="14"/>be said to that moreover, that the Apo 
          <lb ed="#S" n="15"/>stle in the very same place hath made  
          <lb ed="#S" n="16"/>the sonne of God and the holy Church  
          <lb ed="#S" n="17"/>an example for married folkes to fol

          <lb ed="#S" n="21"/>and of the wife to reverence her hus 
          <lb ed="#S" n="22"/>bande and to love him againe, as the  
          <lb ed="#S" n="23"/>Church doth Christ? Than which ex 
          <lb ed="#S" n="24"/>ample, there is none in the world more  
          <lb ed="#S" n="25"/>holy and effectual. For there is no love  
          <lb ed="#S" n="26"/>greater, tha the love of Christ toward  
          <lb ed="#S" n="27"/>his Church. Neither is there any love  
          <lb ed="#S" n="28"/>more chast, tha that which the Church  
          <lb ed="#S" n="29"/>doth beare to Christ.  
          <lb ed="#S" n="30"/>It is therfore required at the hands

          <lb ed="#S" n="48"/>and the whole common weale. Paule

          <lb ed="#S" n="54"/>alreadie spoken in the fift Sermon of

          <lb ed="#S" n="59"/>for heere I will not stand to shew that  
          <lb ed="#S" n="60"/>the honour and glorie of God, is verie  
          <lb ed="#S" n="61"/>greatly augmented, if children be not  
          <lb ed="#S" n="62"/>onely begotten, but also brought up in  
          <lb ed="#S" n="63"/>the feare of god, and knowledge of his  
          <lb ed="#S" n="64"/>worde. Hierocles saith: I confesse that

          <lb ed="#S" n="73"/>adultery. But the Scripture teacheth  
          <lb ed="#S" n="74"/>the contrary. Thou goest to an other  
          <lb ed="#S" n="75"/>woman, thou art an adulterer: Tho  
          <lb ed="#S" n="76"/>breakest they faith, thou art forsworne:

          <lb ed="#S" n="21"/>God? Everie worde doth beare some  
          <lb ed="#S" n="22"/>weight. For adulterie is an heynous  
          <lb ed="#S" n="23"/>sinne. Whereuppon in the Booke of  
          <lb ed="#S" n="24"/>Job wee finde these wordes of Job him  
          <lb ed="#S" n="25"/>selfe. If mine heart have bin decei 
          <lb ed="#S" n="26"/>ved by a woman, or if I have layde  
          <lb ed="#S" n="27"/>waite at my neighbors doore, then  
          <lb ed="#S" n="28"/>let my wife bee an other mansharlot,  
          <lb ed="#S" n="29"/>and let other men have to do with her.  
          <lb ed="#S" n="30"/>For this is a wickednesse and sinne  
          <lb ed="#S" n="31"/>that is worthie to be judged to death.  
          <lb ed="#S" n="32"/>Yea, it is a fire that utterly should con 
          <lb ed="#S" n="33"/>sumer and roote out all mind increase.  
          <lb ed="#S" n="34"/>Job saith, that hee hath not onelie not  
          <lb ed="#S" n="35"/>committed adultery, but that hee hath  
          <lb ed="#S" n="36"/>not so much at any time as once given  
          <lb ed="#S" n="37"/>the attempte to defile an other mans  
          <lb ed="#S" n="38"/>wife. He confesseth that adultery is a  
          <lb ed="#S" n="39"/>sin, &amp; so grievous an offence, taht it do 
          <lb ed="#S" n="40"/>eth deserve to have ye adulterers wife  
          <lb ed="#S" n="41"/>to be defiled with adultery. He addeth,  
          <lb ed="#S" n="42"/>that adultery is a fire that utterly co 
          <lb ed="#S" n="43"/>sumeth and dovoureth al thinges, and  
          <lb ed="#S" n="44"/>lastly that it is a sinne to be judged &amp;  
          <lb ed="#S" n="45"/>punished by death.  
          <lb ed="#S" n="46"/>Moreover Salomon the wisest of al

          <cb ed="#L" n="b"/>
          <lb ed="#S" n="47"/>men saith: May a man take fire in his  
          <lb ed="#S" n="48"/>bosome &amp; his clothes not bee brent?  
          <lb ed="#S" n="49"/>Or can one goe uppon hot coales, and  
          <lb ed="#S" n="50"/>his feete not bee burnt: Even so hee  
          <lb ed="#S" n="51"/>that goeth into his neighbours wife,  
          <lb ed="#S" n="52"/>and toucheth her, cannot be unguil 
          <lb ed="#S" n="53"/>tie. Men doe not utterly despise a  
          <lb ed="#S" n="54"/>theese, that stealeth to satisfie his  
          <lb ed="#S" n="55"/>soule when he is hungrie: But if he  
          <lb ed="#S" n="56"/>may be gotten, he restoreth agayne  
          <lb ed="#S" n="57"/>seven times as much, or else hee ma 
          <lb ed="#S" n="58"/>keth recompence with all the sub 
          <lb ed="#S" n="59"/>staunce of his house. But who so com 
          <lb ed="#S" n="60"/>mitteth adulterie with a woman, hee  
          <lb ed="#S" n="61"/>lacketh understanding: and hee that  
          <lb ed="#S" n="62"/>doth it destroieth his owne soule. He  
          <lb ed="#S" n="63"/>getteth himselfe a plague and disho 
          <lb ed="#S" n="64"/>nour, and his reproch shall never bee  
          <lb ed="#S" n="65"/>put out. For the jealousie and wrath  
          <lb ed="#S" n="66"/>of the man will not be intreated ney 
          <lb ed="#S" n="67"/>ther accepteth hee the person  of anye  
          <lb ed="#S" n="68"/>Mediatour, nor recieveth anie giftes,  
          <lb ed="#S" n="69"/>howe great forever they bee. In these  
          <lb ed="#S" n="70"/>words of Salomon many things are to  
          <lb ed="#S" n="71"/>be noted. First as it cannot otherwise  
          <lb ed="#S" n="72"/>be, but that fire must burn the garmet  
          <lb ed="#S" n="73"/>wherein it is carried: so no man can  
          <lb ed="#S" n="74"/>commit adulterie without damage &amp;  
          <lb ed="#S" n="75"/>daunger of further punishment. Se 
          <lb ed="#S" n="76"/>condarily comparison is made betwixt  
          <lb ed="#S" n="77"/>a theef &amp; an adulterer: not that theft is  
          <lb ed="#S" n="78"/>therby defended, but because theeves,  
          <lb ed="#S" n="79"/>although they bee infamous, doe seeme  
          <lb ed="#S" n="80"/>yet to sinne a great deale lesse than a 
          <lb ed="#S" n="81"/>dulterers do. For a theefe may make  
          <lb ed="#S" n="82"/>satisfaction by restoring ye worth of the  
          <lb ed="#S" n="83"/>thing that he stole, to him, from whom  
          <lb ed="#S" n="84"/>hee stole it away: but for adulterie no  
          <lb ed="#S" n="85"/>amends can be made. And what is hee  
          <lb ed="#S" n="86"/>that woulde not rather wishe to have  
          <lb ed="#S" n="87"/>Theeves ransacke his Chest, and take

          <lb ed="#S" n="89"/>his wife his dealing, defiled with ad

          <lb ed="#S" n="91"/>Moreover Salomo calleth the adul 
          <lb ed="#S" n="92"/>terer madde and without understan

          <cb ed="#L" n="a"/>
          <lb ed="#S" n="1"/>ding. Adulterie is judged to be a sinne  
          <lb ed="#S" n="2"/>worthy of death and endlesse infamie.  
          <lb ed="#S" n="3"/>For the Lord in the lawe doth not say  
          <lb ed="#S" n="4"/>onely, Thou shalt not commit adulte 
          <lb ed="#S" n="5"/>rie, But in another place also goeth  
          <lb ed="#S" n="6"/>on, and addeth: And he that commit 
          <lb ed="#S" n="7"/>teth adulterie with another mannes  
          <lb ed="#S" n="8"/>wife, even he that committeth adul 
          <lb ed="#S" n="9"/>tery with his neighbours wife, let both  
          <lb ed="#S" n="10"/>the adulterer and the adulteresse bee  
          <lb ed="#S" n="11"/>slaine. Levit. 20. And this punish 
          <lb ed="#S" n="12"/>ment of adultery by death was not ab 
          <lb ed="#S" n="13"/>rogated or chaunged by the very Gen 
          <lb ed="#S" n="14"/>tiles. For the Romane law called Lex  
          <lb ed="#S" n="15"/>Julia is very wel knowen, how it com 
          <lb ed="#S" n="16"/>manded adulterers to be put to death.  
          <lb ed="#S" n="17"/>Which law was of force in the time of  
          <lb ed="#S" n="18"/>S. Hierome, as we may gather by the  
          <lb ed="#S" n="19"/>hystory which he wrate of an adulte 
          <lb ed="#S" n="20"/>resse, at the chopping off of whole head  
          <lb ed="#S" n="21"/>seven strokes were give. Neither is it  
          <lb ed="#S" n="22"/>marvaile undoubtedly, that adultery  
          <lb ed="#S" n="23"/>was among them of old, and is yet at  
          <lb ed="#S" n="24"/>this day according to the lawes, to bee  
          <lb ed="#S" n="25"/>punished by death. For upon that one  
          <lb ed="#S" n="26"/>many sinnes do depend.  
          <lb ed="#S" n="27"/>First of all the adulterer is a perju 
          <lb ed="#S" n="28"/>red man. For he hath broken and vio 
          <lb ed="#S" n="29"/>lated the faith which he gave opely be 
          <lb ed="#S" n="30"/>fore God and the face of the Cogrega 
          <lb ed="#S" n="31"/>tion by calling to witnesse the most  
          <lb ed="#S" n="32"/>holy and reverend Trinity, when the  
          <lb ed="#S" n="33"/>minister of Christ did solemnize the  
          <lb ed="#S" n="34"/>marriage and couple him to his wife,  
          <lb ed="#S" n="35"/>by giving hand in hande. Secondari 
          <lb ed="#S" n="36"/>ly the adulterer hath committed theft  
          <lb ed="#S" n="37"/>and robberie. For whe the adulteresse  
          <lb ed="#S" n="38"/>doth make her body common to an o 
          <lb ed="#S" n="39"/>ther man, then doth she set to sale, de 
          <lb ed="#S" n="40"/>file and marre, not her owne, but her  
          <lb ed="#S" n="41"/>husbandes bodye. Thirdly bastardes  
          <lb ed="#S" n="42"/>borne in adulterie do often times en 
          <lb ed="#S" n="43"/>joy an equall parte of inheritaunce  
          <lb ed="#S" n="44"/>with the right begotte childre. Which  
          <lb ed="#S" n="45"/>cannot be without great wrong done  
          <lb ed="#S" n="46"/>to the lawfull heyres and legitimate  
          <!--233.xml-->
          <pb ed="#L" n="233"/>
          <cb ed="#L" n="b"/>
          <lb ed="#S" n="47"/>ofspring. For they are against al right  
          <lb ed="#S" n="48"/>robbed of their due inheritance, wher 
          <lb ed="#S" n="49"/>of an equall position is given to him, to  
          <lb ed="#S" n="50"/>whom by lawe no parcell is due. Last 
          <lb ed="#S" n="51"/>ly beside all these, innumerable mis 
          <lb ed="#S" n="52"/>chiefers doe spring of adulterie. Since  
          <lb ed="#S" n="53"/>therefore that it is a Serpent with so  
          <lb ed="#S" n="54"/>many heads, both the lawes of God &amp;  
          <lb ed="#S" n="55"/>me doe rightly punish adulterers with  
          <lb ed="#S" n="56"/>losse of life.  
          <lb ed="#S" n="57"/>But some jolly fellowes there are  
          <lb ed="#S" n="58"/>forsooth, that of adultery do make but  
          <lb ed="#S" n="59"/>a sport. They are perswaded that Da 
          <lb ed="#S" n="60"/>vids adultery doth make on their side,  
          <lb ed="#S" n="61"/>and that place of scripture, where wee  
          <lb ed="#S" n="62"/>read, that the Lord was savourable to  
          <lb ed="#S" n="63"/>the adulteresse, that was taken eve as  
          <lb ed="#S" n="64"/>the deede was in doing. Why doe not  
          <lb ed="#S" n="65"/>these merrye conceyted men consider  
          <lb ed="#S" n="66"/>howe severely the Lorde did punishe  
          <lb ed="#S" n="67"/>David for that offence? The bloudye  
          <lb ed="#S" n="68"/>house of David was immediatly after  
          <lb ed="#S" n="69"/>defiled with filthie incest. For Amnon  
          <lb ed="#S" n="70"/>doth perforce defloure his sister Tha 
          <lb ed="#S" n="71"/>mar. And streight way upon the necke  
          <lb ed="#S" n="72"/>of that again, his house is defamed by  
          <lb ed="#S" n="73"/>most cruell parricide, while Absolom  
          <lb ed="#S" n="74"/>in a banquet murdred his brother Am 
          <lb ed="#S" n="75"/>non. the verye same Absalom also  
          <lb ed="#S" n="76"/>Davids sonne, defileth or deflowreth  
          <lb ed="#S" n="77"/>his fathers wives, and that openly too,  
          <lb ed="#S" n="78"/>laying all feare of God and shame a 
          <lb ed="#S" n="79"/>side. Hee driveth his father out of his  
          <lb ed="#S" n="80"/>kingdome, and hasteneth on to shorten  
          <lb ed="#S" n="81"/>his daies. Al which calamities David  
          <lb ed="#S" n="82"/>confesseth, that he doth worthily su 
          <lb ed="#S" n="83"/>staine, for the adulterie * murther by  
          <lb ed="#S" n="84"/>him committed. Lastly, many thou 
          <lb ed="#S" n="85"/>sands of his people were slayne in the  
          <lb ed="#S" n="86"/>battaile: David himselfe is harly and  
          <lb ed="#S" n="87"/>with much a doe restored to his king 
          <lb ed="#S" n="88"/>dome, and afterward beeyng restored,  
          <lb ed="#S" n="89"/>hee repented his sinne all the dayes of  
          <lb ed="#S" n="90"/>his life.  
          <lb ed="#S" n="91"/>Now it is marvel, if adulterers (cou 
          <lb ed="#S" n="92"/>dering these punishets) will goe on yet  
          <!--234.xml-->
          <pb ed="#L" n="234"/>
          <cb ed="#L" n="a"/>
          <lb ed="#S" n="1"/>to alledge the exaple of David in de 
          <lb ed="#S" n="2"/>fence of their naughtinesse. Our Sa 
          <lb ed="#S" n="3"/>viour did not come into the world to be  
          <lb ed="#S" n="4"/>a Judge but a Saviour, neither did hee  
          <lb ed="#S" n="5"/>in any place usurp and take to himselfe  
          <lb ed="#S" n="6"/>the right of the sword. Who therefore  
          <lb ed="#S" n="7"/>wil make any marveile at it, to see the  
          <lb ed="#S" n="8"/>adultresse not condemned by him, to be  
          <lb ed="#S" n="9"/>stoned to death? yet hee sayde: Hath  
          <lb ed="#S" n="10"/>no man condemned thee? as if hee  
          <lb ed="#S" n="11"/>minded not to have resisted the lawe, if  
          <lb ed="#S" n="12"/>judgement had once passed uppon her.  
          <lb ed="#S" n="13"/>For he came not to be a patrone to ad 
          <lb ed="#S" n="14"/>ulterers, not to breake the lawe, but  
          <lb ed="#S" n="15"/>to fulfille it. But if it like adulterers  
          <lb ed="#S" n="16"/>wel, that the adulteresse was not con 
          <lb ed="#S" n="17"/>demned of the Lord, then let them also  
          <lb ed="#S" n="18"/>like that sentence, wherwith the Hy 
          <lb ed="#S" n="19"/>storie is ended, when the Lorde saith:  
          <lb ed="#S" n="20"/>Goe thy waies and sinne no more.  
          <lb ed="#S" n="21"/>Let them therefore leave off the defile  
          <lb ed="#S" n="22"/>&amp; destroy themselves with filthy ad 
          <lb ed="#S" n="23"/>dulerie.  
          <lb ed="#S" n="24"/>The Lord in his law hath expresse 
          <lb ed="#S" n="25"/>lye named adulterie alone, but there 
          <lb ed="#S" n="26"/>withal he doth inclusively understand  
          <lb ed="#S" n="27"/>all kindes of lust and luxurie, and all  
          <lb ed="#S" n="28"/>things else which do egge forward and  
          <lb ed="#S" n="29"/>stirre up fire in men to wantonnesse,  
          <lb ed="#S" n="30"/>which he forbiddeth as severely as ad 
          <lb ed="#S" n="31"/>ulterie it selfe. The Lorde in the Gos 
          <lb ed="#S" n="32"/>pell doth not onely forbid the outward  
          <lb ed="#S" n="33"/>work of adulterie, but the very affecti 
          <lb ed="#S" n="34"/>on also and wanton lust of the hearte  
          <lb ed="#S" n="35"/>and minde. Yee have heard (saith he)  
          <lb ed="#S" n="36"/>that it was said to them of olde, Thou  
          <lb ed="#S" n="37"/>shalt not commit adulterie. But I say  
          <lb ed="#S" n="38"/>unto you, that whosoever looketh on  
          <lb ed="#S" n="39"/>a woman to lust after her, hath com

          <lb ed="#S" n="63"/>the Evangelists &amp; Apostles doth teach  
          <lb ed="#S" n="64"/>us the contrarie. For the Apostles in

          <lb ed="#S" n="40"/>thou consentedst unto him: and hast  
          <lb ed="#S" n="41"/>been partaker with the adulterers, &amp; c.

          <lb ed="#S" n="43"/>all these offences in wicked men, eve 
          <lb ed="#S" n="44"/>rie one according to the greatnesse of  
          <lb ed="#S" n="45"/>the sin. For some sins are farre more  
          <lb ed="#S" n="46"/>heynous than other some are. Hee is

          <lb ed="#S" n="47"/>an adulterer that in his minde doeth  
          <lb ed="#S" n="48"/>lust after an other mans wife: but hee  
          <lb ed="#S" n="49"/>sinneth more greevously, if hee inde 
          <lb ed="#S" n="50"/>vour to finishe in deede his wicked  
          <lb ed="#S" n="51"/>thought, hee offendeth yet more deepe 
          <lb ed="#S" n="52"/>ly if hee doe the deede, and sinneth most  
          <lb ed="#S" n="53"/>of all, if after once, hee fall unto it a 
          <lb ed="#S" n="54"/>gaine. Likewise the adulterer sinneth,  
          <lb ed="#S" n="55"/>so doth the bawde, and he also that up 
          <lb ed="#S" n="56"/>holdeth his adulterie. The whore 
          <lb ed="#S" n="57"/>monger sinneth deepely, but hee that  
          <lb ed="#S" n="58"/>defileth himselfe with incest, sinneth  
          <lb ed="#S" n="59"/>more greevously, and hee most hey 
          <lb ed="#S" n="60"/>nously of all, that in medling with  
          <lb ed="#S" n="61"/>beasts, comitteth filthy Sodomy. So  
          <lb ed="#S" n="62"/>then in this 7. precept charge is given  
          <lb ed="#S" n="63"/>for the maintenance of shamefastnes,  
          <lb ed="#S" n="64"/>modestie, sobriety, temperancy, cha 
          <lb ed="#S" n="65"/>stity, publike honestie, and true ho 
          <lb ed="#S" n="66"/>linesse of soule and bodie. The next is  
          <lb ed="#S" n="67"/>for me to say somewhat now touching  
          <lb ed="#S" n="68"/>continencie.  
          <lb ed="#S" n="69"/>By abstinence we refraine from o 
          <lb ed="#S" n="70"/>ther mens goods, and take from no ma  
          <lb ed="#S" n="71"/>the thing that is his. Some there are  
          <lb ed="#S" n="72"/>that will have temperancie to extend  
          <lb ed="#S" n="73"/>farther than continencie: for they wil  
          <lb ed="#S" n="74"/>make the one to be but a part of the o 
          <lb ed="#S" n="75"/>ther. I, in this treatise, doe simplye  
          <lb ed="#S" n="76"/>make continencie the contrarie to in 
          <lb ed="#S" n="77"/>temperancie or incontinencie. For  
          <lb ed="#S" n="78"/>continency is a vertue or power of  
          <lb ed="#S" n="79"/>the minde, received from the spirite of  
          <lb ed="#S" n="80"/>God, which suppresseth affections, and  
          <lb ed="#S" n="81"/>doth not in any wife permit unlawful  
          <lb ed="#S" n="82"/>pleasures. This is conversant &amp; doth  
          <lb ed="#S" n="83"/>shew it selfe in the common and viual  
          <lb ed="#S" n="84"/>talke of men, in pleasures that are al 
          <lb ed="#S" n="85"/>lowed, in apparell, in buildings and  
          <lb ed="#S" n="86"/>dwelling houses, in meate and drink,  
          <lb ed="#S" n="87"/>and in other things also. I at this pre 
          <lb ed="#S" n="88"/>sent will onely examine those poyntes  
          <lb ed="#S" n="89"/>of continencie, which are already re 
          <lb ed="#S" n="90"/>hearsed.  
          <lb ed="#S" n="91"/>First of all it is required of us to  
          <lb ed="#S" n="92"/>keepe in our tongue, and not to let it

          <lb ed="#S" n="1"/>loose at randon to the blaspheming of  
          <lb ed="#S" n="2"/>Gods glory, or hurt of our neighbour.  
          <lb ed="#S" n="3"/>Let the talke of a Christian man bee  
          <lb ed="#S" n="4"/>honest, profitable, and seasoned with  
          <lb ed="#S" n="5"/>salt, let it bee unacquainted with scof 
          <lb ed="#S" n="6"/>fing, lightnesse, lying, ribauldrie,  
          <lb ed="#S" n="7"/>and filthinesse. S. James in the third  
          <lb ed="#S" n="8"/>Chapter of his Epistle hath spoken  
          <lb ed="#S" n="9"/>sufficiently of the tongues properties.  
          <lb ed="#S" n="10"/>In his first Chapter also hee saieth:  
          <lb ed="#S" n="11"/>Let everie man bee swift to heare.  
          <lb ed="#S" n="12"/>flowe to speake, and flowe to anger.  
          <lb ed="#S" n="13"/>And Paul sayeth: Let no filthie com 
          <lb ed="#S" n="14"/>munication proceede out of your  
          <lb ed="#S" n="15"/>mouth, but that which is good to e 
          <lb ed="#S" n="16"/>difie withall, as oft as neede is, that  
          <lb ed="#S" n="17"/>it maye minister grace unto the hea 
          <lb ed="#S" n="18"/>rers, and greeve not the holie spirite  
          <lb ed="#S" n="19"/>of God, by whom yee are sealed un 
          <lb ed="#S" n="20"/>to the daye of Redemption. And a 
          <lb ed="#S" n="21"/>gayne: Let not fornication, or anye  
          <lb ed="#S" n="22"/>uncleannesse, or covetousnesse, bee  
          <lb ed="#S" n="23"/>once named among you, as it be 
          <lb ed="#S" n="24"/>commeth Saintes. Neither filthinesse,  
          <lb ed="#S" n="25"/>nor foolish talking, neyther jesting,  
          <lb ed="#S" n="26"/>which are not seemely, but rather gi 
          <lb ed="#S" n="27"/>ving of thankes. Let no man deceive  
          <lb ed="#S" n="28"/>you with vayne wordes. For, for such  
          <lb ed="#S" n="29"/>thinges commeth the wrath of God  
          <lb ed="#S" n="30"/>uppon the children of disobedience.  
          <lb ed="#S" n="31"/>For in another place hee citeth this  
          <lb ed="#S" n="32"/>sentence out of Menander and saith:  
          <lb ed="#S" n="33"/>Ill woordes corrupt good manners.  
          <lb ed="#S" n="34"/>Moreover a mans minde is bewrayed  
          <lb ed="#S" n="35"/>by his talke: for of the hearts aboun

          <lb ed="#S" n="37"/>fore in any thing then in tongue especi 
          <lb ed="#S" n="38"/>al it behoveth Christians to be sober &amp;  
          <lb ed="#S" n="39"/>continent.  
          <lb ed="#S" n="40"/>The Lord (I confesse) hath graun

          <lb ed="#S" n="48"/>of a dwelling place coveniently situa 
          <lb ed="#S" n="49"/>ted against the untemperatenesse of  
          <lb ed="#S" n="50"/>the ayre, and biddeth us not to wan 
          <lb ed="#S" n="51"/>der like beastes and cattell, through  
          <lb ed="#S" n="52"/>fields and desolate woods. Hee hath for  
          <lb ed="#S" n="53"/>our necessitie and pleasaunt feeding,  
          <lb ed="#S" n="54"/>allowed us the use of meate &amp; drinke.

          <lb ed="#S" n="59"/>a godly man doth enjoy them, doth use  
          <lb ed="#S" n="60"/>them, and is delighted with the honest  
          <lb ed="#S" n="61"/>pleasure of them, let him give thanks  
          <lb ed="#S" n="62"/>to God, and use them moderatly in the  
          <lb ed="#S" n="63"/>feare of the Lorde. For in so doing hee  
          <lb ed="#S" n="64"/>sinneth not against the Lorde: but by  
          <lb ed="#S" n="65"/>the abuse of those thinges, by unthak

          <lb ed="#S" n="72"/>neede not heare againe to repeat it un

          <lb ed="#S" n="53"/>do live in this bodie, the flesh doth still  
          <lb ed="#S" n="54"/>resist the spirite, and most of all rebel 
          <lb ed="#S" n="55"/>leth then, when we  with delicates doe  
          <lb ed="#S" n="56"/>pamper the bodie. Wherefore fasting  
          <lb ed="#S" n="57"/>doth draw from the bodie everie evil.  
          <lb ed="#S" n="58"/>which stirreth up and strengtheneth it  
          <lb ed="#S" n="59"/>against the good commaundements of  
          <lb ed="#S" n="60"/>Gods holie spirite.  
          <lb ed="#S" n="61"/>Now the necessitie, for which wee  
          <lb ed="#S" n="62"/>keepe this fasting, is of two fortes,  
          <lb ed="#S" n="63"/>publique and private. Wee fast for  
          <lb ed="#S" n="64"/>the publique or common necessitie,  
          <lb ed="#S" n="65"/>when some calamitie doeth either op 
          <lb ed="#S" n="66"/>presse or else hang over the head of  
          <lb ed="#S" n="67"/>the Church. Oh such a manner of fa 
          <lb ed="#S" n="68"/>sting we see examples in the 2 chap. of  
          <lb ed="#S" n="69"/>Joel, and in the 3. of Jonas his prophe 
          <lb ed="#S" n="70"/>cie: which verie same order in fasting  
          <lb ed="#S" n="71"/>was used in the time of our Lord A 
          <lb ed="#S" n="72"/>postles: as it is evidently extant in the  
          <lb ed="#S" n="73"/>Acts of the Apostle. And this kinde  
          <lb ed="#S" n="74"/>of fasting doth seeme to have differed  
          <lb ed="#S" n="75"/>verie little among them of olde, from  
          <lb ed="#S" n="76"/>a generall mourning: yea it seemeth  
          <lb ed="#S" n="77"/>altogether to have beene nothing else,  
          <lb ed="#S" n="78"/>but a kind of lamenting. In the scrip 
          <lb ed="#S" n="79"/>tures every booke is full of examples,  
          <lb ed="#S" n="80"/>which teach and instruct as howe the  
          <lb ed="#S" n="81"/>holy Saints did humble themselves in  
          <lb ed="#S" n="82"/>the fight of God with true repentance  
          <lb ed="#S" n="83"/>for their sinnes and offences. Private  
          <lb ed="#S" n="84"/>necessitie is that for which everie par 
          <lb ed="#S" n="85"/>ticular man doth fast when hee feeleth  
          <lb ed="#S" n="86"/>himselfe to be vexed with bodily con 
          <lb ed="#S" n="87"/>cupiscence, that thereby hee may take  
          <lb ed="#S" n="88"/>from the flesh the flame and fewell,  
          <lb ed="#S" n="89"/>least the body at last be fixed and bur 
          <lb ed="#S" n="90"/>ned. For the Lord in the Gospel saide,  
          <lb ed="#S" n="91"/>that the children of the bride chamber  
          <lb ed="#S" n="92"/>do fast when the bridegroome is taken  
          <!--243.xml-->
          <pb ed="#L" n="243"/>
          <cb ed="#L" n="a"/>
          <lb ed="#S" n="1"/>from them, that is, in a hard and dan 
          <lb ed="#S" n="2"/>gerous time. The marriage doth sig 
          <lb ed="#S" n="3"/>nifie the bond whereby we are knit to  
          <lb ed="#S" n="4"/>Christ in saith, and the holy Ghost.  
          <lb ed="#S" n="5"/>This yet not withstanding, the godlie  
          <lb ed="#S" n="6"/>man doth still rejoyce. Hee doth with  
          <lb ed="#S" n="7"/>giving of thankes, and temperancie  
          <lb ed="#S" n="8"/>both eate and drinke so much as is suf 
          <lb ed="#S" n="9"/>ficient, and is delighted also in these  
          <lb ed="#S" n="10"/>externall giftes of God: but when hee  
          <lb ed="#S" n="11"/>feeleth that the bridegroome is readie  
          <lb ed="#S" n="12"/>for to depart, or that he is nowe al 
          <lb ed="#S" n="13"/>readie almost departed out of his  
          <lb ed="#S" n="14"/>heart, that is, when hee feeleth that  
          <lb ed="#S" n="15"/>the spirit is extinguished by the fleshes  
          <lb ed="#S" n="16"/>wantonnesse, and that sayth doth  
          <lb ed="#S" n="17"/>once beginne to be colde, then doth hee  
          <lb ed="#S" n="18"/>settle himselfe to prayer and doeth ap 
          <lb ed="#S" n="19"/>point a solemne fasting, thereby ei 
          <lb ed="#S" n="20"/>ther to keepe the bridegroome still, or  
          <lb ed="#S" n="21"/>else to pull him backe being readie to  
          <lb ed="#S" n="22"/>departe.  
          <lb ed="#S" n="23"/>But neither publique nor private  
          <lb ed="#S" n="24"/>fasting can abide to be enforced. For  
          <lb ed="#S" n="25"/>they will not be compelled, but desire  
          <lb ed="#S" n="26"/>to proceede of a free, theerefull, and  
          <lb ed="#S" n="27"/>voluntarie minde. Unwilling men  
          <lb ed="#S" n="28"/>doe nothing well. God requireth a  
          <lb ed="#S" n="29"/>chearefull giver. Moreover, let fa 
          <lb ed="#S" n="30"/>stings be moderated according to the  
          <lb ed="#S" n="31"/>qualitie of places, persons, perils, and  
          <lb ed="#S" n="32"/>temptations: if they be not continual,  
          <lb ed="#S" n="33"/>yet let them be often, till such time as  
          <lb ed="#S" n="34"/>we be delivered and ridde utterly of  
          <lb ed="#S" n="35"/>them. Let them be without supersti 
          <lb ed="#S" n="36"/>tion and fained hypocrise as our Lord  
          <lb ed="#S" n="37"/>in the first of S. Mathewes Gospell  
          <lb ed="#S" n="38"/>hath taught us. Herewithall doe the  
          <lb ed="#S" n="39"/>wordes of S. Hierome agree very wel,  
          <lb ed="#S" n="40"/>which he wrote to Nepolianus tou 
          <lb ed="#S" n="41"/>ching fasting, as followeth, Prescribe  
          <lb ed="#S" n="42"/>to thy selfe so long a time to fast in, as  
          <lb ed="#S" n="43"/>thine abilitie will suffer thee to beare.  
          <lb ed="#S" n="44"/>Let thy fastings be pure, uncorrupt,  
          <lb ed="#S" n="45"/>simple, moderated, and not super 
          <lb ed="#S" n="46"/>stitious. What availeth it to eate no

          <pb ed="#L" n="243"/>
          <cb ed="#L" n="b"/>
          <lb ed="#S" n="47"/>oyle, and to seeke out such seldome  
          <lb ed="#S" n="48"/>fond cates, as are harde to bee come  
          <lb ed="#S" n="49"/>by, as figges, pepper, nuttes, dates,  
          <lb ed="#S" n="50"/>pure flowre for overfine breade, and  
          <lb ed="#S" n="51"/>honie? The gardens with digging  
          <lb ed="#S" n="52"/>for novelties, are turned over and  
          <lb ed="#S" n="53"/>over, beacuse wee will not eate  
          <lb ed="#S" n="54"/>common cribble breade, and so while  
          <lb ed="#S" n="55"/>our daintie mouthes seeke after deli 
          <lb ed="#S" n="56"/>cates, our soules are pulled from  
          <lb ed="#S" n="57"/>the kingdome of Heaven. I heare  
          <lb ed="#S" n="58"/>moreover, that some men there are,  
          <lb ed="#S" n="59"/>which (contrarie to nature) refuse to  
          <lb ed="#S" n="60"/>drinke water and feede upon breade,  
          <lb ed="#S" n="61"/>but sucke uppe and swallowe verie  
          <lb ed="#S" n="62"/>costly suppings, daintie hearbe  
          <lb ed="#S" n="63"/>broths, and the juce of Beetes, not out  
          <lb ed="#S" n="64"/>of a cup, but out of a shell. O shame,  
          <lb ed="#S" n="65"/>blush we not at such fond toyes, and  
          <lb ed="#S" n="66"/>are wee not ashamed of such supersti 
          <lb ed="#S" n="67"/>tion? Thus much sayeth Hierome,  
          <lb ed="#S" n="68"/>And it is evident, that even at this  
          <lb ed="#S" n="69"/>day this vice is especially received a 
          <lb ed="#S" n="70"/>mong our wealthie and religious  
          <lb ed="#S" n="71"/>men.  
          <lb ed="#S" n="72"/>But the end of Christian fastings,  
          <lb ed="#S" n="73"/>are, that the Church, or sinner shoulde  
          <lb ed="#S" n="74"/>submitte and humble them selves be 
          <lb ed="#S" n="75"/>fore the Lord, that the flesh would be  
          <lb ed="#S" n="76"/>obedient and subject to the spirite, that  
          <lb ed="#S" n="77"/>the flesh should not hinder the sinner  
          <lb ed="#S" n="78"/>to worke righteousnesse, and that the  
          <lb ed="#S" n="79"/>intent and minde of him that prayeth  
          <lb ed="#S" n="80"/>shoulde bee the more earnestly bent  
          <lb ed="#S" n="81"/>toward God. For fasting is of the  
          <lb ed="#S" n="82"/>number of those workes, which of  
          <lb ed="#S" n="83"/>themselves are not absolute and per 
          <lb ed="#S" n="84"/>feit, but have an other meaning, for  
          <lb ed="#S" n="85"/>which they are ordained to an other  
          <lb ed="#S" n="86"/>ende and purpose: therefore fasting  
          <lb ed="#S" n="87"/>is a certaine helpe to the prayers  
          <lb ed="#S" n="88"/>and vertues of godly men Where 
          <lb ed="#S" n="89"/>uppon in the Prophetes wee finde,  
          <lb ed="#S" n="90"/>that the fastings of the Jewes dis 
          <lb ed="#S" n="91"/>pleased the Lorde: for they did naught  
          <lb ed="#S" n="92"/>else but fast alone, that is, they did at  
          <!--244.xml-->
          <pb ed="#L" n="244"/>
          <cb ed="#L" n="a"/>
          <lb ed="#S" n="1"/>a certaine and appointed time abstain  
          <lb ed="#S" n="2"/>from their usuall maner of eating, but  
          <lb ed="#S" n="3"/>they restrained not themselves from  
          <lb ed="#S" n="4"/>sinne and wickednesse, but let their  
          <lb ed="#S" n="5"/>flesh have the bridle at will, when as  
          <lb ed="#S" n="6"/>in deede they shoulde have ceassed to  
          <lb ed="#S" n="7"/>have pampered it, that thereby it be 
          <lb ed="#S" n="8"/>ing the weaker, the spirite might be:  
          <lb ed="#S" n="9"/>the stronger to doe and fulfill all sort  
          <lb ed="#S" n="10"/>of good workes. And therefore, saith  
          <lb ed="#S" n="11"/>the Lorde: I have not chosen such a  
          <lb ed="#S" n="12"/>manner of faiting: and the rest as it  
          <lb ed="#S" n="13"/>foloweth in the 58. chapter of Elaye,  
          <lb ed="#S" n="14"/>and in the 7. and 8. chapters of Zacha 
          <lb ed="#S" n="15"/>ries prophecie.  
          <lb ed="#S" n="16"/>The Apostle Paul verily doth ex 
          <lb ed="#S" n="17"/>pressly say, that MEate commendeth us  
          <lb ed="#S" n="18"/>not to God: for neither if wee eate  
          <lb ed="#S" n="19"/>have wee anie thing the more, neither  
          <lb ed="#S" n="20"/>if we eate not have we anie thing the  
          <lb ed="#S" n="21"/>lesse. He therefore doth not fast truely,  
          <lb ed="#S" n="22"/>which doth abstaine onely at a cer 
          <lb ed="#S" n="23"/>taine appointed time from certaine  
          <lb ed="#S" n="24"/>manner of meates, but he which doth  
          <lb ed="#S" n="25"/>therefore refraine from the pleasures  
          <lb ed="#S" n="26"/>of the flesh, that thereby hee may make  
          <lb ed="#S" n="27"/>it subject to the spirit, &amp; do the workes  
          <lb ed="#S" n="28"/>of faith and charitie, which are accep 
          <lb ed="#S" n="29"/>table in the sight of the Lord. If there 
          <lb ed="#S" n="30"/>fore thou doest desire to fast a true  
          <lb ed="#S" n="31"/>fast, eate, drinke, and sleepe, and take  
          <lb ed="#S" n="32"/>heede to thy bodie that it waxe not in 
          <lb ed="#S" n="33"/>solent, fast from all sinne, eate not the  
          <lb ed="#S" n="34"/>meate of malice, taste not the juncats  
          <lb ed="#S" n="35"/>of lust and pleasure, and bee not set on  
          <lb ed="#S" n="36"/>fire with the wine of wantonnesse.  
          <lb ed="#S" n="37"/>Fast from evill deedes, abstaine from  
          <lb ed="#S" n="38"/>evill wordes, and refraine thy selfe  
          <lb ed="#S" n="39"/>from naughtie thoughts. For Basile  
          <lb ed="#S" n="40"/>also saith: True fasting consisteth in  
          <lb ed="#S" n="41"/>freenesse from vices, in continencie of  
          <lb ed="#S" n="42"/>tongue, in suppressing of anger, in  
          <lb ed="#S" n="43"/>cutting off concupiscence, backbiting,  
          <lb ed="#S" n="44"/>lying, and perjurie, &amp;c. But even as  
          <lb ed="#S" n="45"/>the good workes from selves, which  
          <lb ed="#S" n="46"/>are done by faith, doe not merite the  
          <!--244.xml-->
          <pb ed="#L" n="244"/>
          <cb ed="#L" n="b"/>
          <lb ed="#S" n="47"/>kingdome of heaven (for that glory is  
          <lb ed="#S" n="48"/>due to the merite of Christ alone) e 
          <lb ed="#S" n="49"/>ven so fasting, which is an aide and  
          <lb ed="#S" n="50"/>helpe to good workes, doth not meri 
          <lb ed="#S" n="51"/>toriously deserve the kingdome of  
          <lb ed="#S" n="52"/>God.  
          <lb ed="#S" n="53"/>But now I see a doubtfull disputa 
          <lb ed="#S" n="54"/>tion arise among the most divines of  
          <lb ed="#S" n="55"/>this our age, touching the time and  
          <lb ed="#S" n="56"/>manner of fastings, and also of ye choice  
          <lb ed="#S" n="57"/>of meates. Some there are which af 
          <lb ed="#S" n="58"/>firme and upholde the fastes of Lent,  
          <lb ed="#S" n="59"/>the embring dayes and such other to  
          <lb ed="#S" n="60"/>be the fastes which God hath appoin 
          <lb ed="#S" n="61"/>ted. There are that say thou hast not  
          <lb ed="#S" n="62"/>fasted, if by any meanes thou tast anie  
          <lb ed="#S" n="63"/>flesh. And their are, which prescribe  
          <lb ed="#S" n="64"/>and appoint some certaine houres to  
          <lb ed="#S" n="65"/>fast in. But I for my part see not a 
          <lb ed="#S" n="66"/>nie such doctrines to bee taught us in  
          <lb ed="#S" n="67"/>the Scriptures. For the Lord in the  
          <lb ed="#S" n="68"/>Gospell kept not any of their devised  
          <lb ed="#S" n="69"/>fasts, when hee fasted fourtie dayes,  
          <lb ed="#S" n="70"/>but did altogether abstaine from all  
          <lb ed="#S" n="71"/>kinds of meate, even as Moses and  
          <lb ed="#S" n="72"/>Helias had also done: wherefore hee  
          <lb ed="#S" n="73"/>by taht deede of his, did not give us a 
          <lb ed="#S" n="74"/>ny law to fast so. Moreover the Lorde  
          <lb ed="#S" n="75"/>in the gospell doeth evidently teach,  
          <lb ed="#S" n="76"/>that the thing, which entreth in by the  
          <lb ed="#S" n="77"/>mouth, doth not defile the ma, but that  
          <lb ed="#S" n="78"/>which issueth out from his heart. To  
          <lb ed="#S" n="79"/>the pure are all thinges pure. And  
          <lb ed="#S" n="80"/>Paul saith: I know, and am perswaded  
          <lb ed="#S" n="81"/>through the Lorde Jesus Christ, that  
          <lb ed="#S" n="82"/>nothing is common of it selfe, but to  
          <lb ed="#S" n="83"/>him that thinketh that anie thing is  
          <lb ed="#S" n="84"/>common, to him is it common. Again,  
          <lb ed="#S" n="85"/>Let not him which eateth, despise  
          <lb ed="#S" n="86"/>him which eateth not, nor let him  
          <lb ed="#S" n="87"/>which eateth not, judge him which  
          <lb ed="#S" n="88"/>eateth: for him taht eateth the Lorde  
          <lb ed="#S" n="89"/>hath taken. Moreover the place is e 
          <lb ed="#S" n="90"/>vident which the same Paul writeth  
          <lb ed="#S" n="91"/>in the fourth chapter of his Epistle to  
          <lb ed="#S" n="92"/>Timothie, where hee affirmeth, that  
          <!--245.xml-->
          <pb ed="#L" n="245"/>
          <cb ed="#L" n="a"/>
          <lb ed="#S" n="1"/>the forbidding of meates is a doctrine  
          <lb ed="#S" n="2"/>of devils. Neither needeth anie man  
          <lb ed="#S" n="3"/>here to tell us any whit of the Tacians  
          <lb ed="#S" n="4"/>and Encratites: for they did flaunder  
          <lb ed="#S" n="5"/>the good creatures of God. Paul spea 
          <lb ed="#S" n="6"/>keth of them, who, although they doe  
          <lb ed="#S" n="7"/>not utterly condeme meate and ma 
          <lb ed="#S" n="8"/>riage doe yet notwithstanding forbid  
          <lb ed="#S" n="9"/>the use of meate.  
          <lb ed="#S" n="10"/>Furthermore we doe not read that  
          <lb ed="#S" n="11"/>any lawes were ordeyned in that age  
          <lb ed="#S" n="12"/>which followeth next after the prea

          <lb ed="#S" n="15"/>der of fasting, or choise of meates. I  
          <lb ed="#S" n="16"/>will rehearse unto you (dearely belo 
          <lb ed="#S" n="17"/>ved) the wordes of Irenaeus the mar 
          <lb ed="#S" n="18"/>tyre, which in the Ecclesiasticall histo 
          <lb ed="#S" n="19"/>rie of Eusebius, are to be found worde  
          <lb ed="#S" n="20"/>for worde as they are here set downe.  
          <lb ed="#S" n="21"/>The ocntroversie is not onely tou 
          <lb ed="#S" n="22"/>ching Easter day, but also touching  
          <lb ed="#S" n="23"/>the manner of fasting. For some doe  
          <lb ed="#S" n="24"/>thinke that the fast ought to be kept  
          <lb ed="#S" n="25"/>but one day onely, other two, other  
          <lb ed="#S" n="26"/>more, and some whoale 4.0 dayes, so  
          <lb ed="#S" n="27"/>that counting the houres of the night  
          <lb ed="#S" n="28"/>and day, they make a day. Which dif 
          <lb ed="#S" n="29"/>ference of observing the times, is not  
          <lb ed="#S" n="30"/>nowe first of all in our age begon, but  
          <lb ed="#S" n="31"/>was brought in a greate while agoe (as  
          <lb ed="#S" n="32"/>I suppose) of them which did not sim 
          <lb ed="#S" n="33"/>ply keepe that, which was taught from  
          <lb ed="#S" n="34"/>the beginning, but eyther by negli 
          <lb ed="#S" n="35"/>gence or unskilfulnesse fell afterwarde  
          <lb ed="#S" n="36"/>into a worser use and custome. And  
          <lb ed="#S" n="37"/>yet notwithstanding, all these though  
          <lb ed="#S" n="38"/>they jarred in the observation of times,  
          <lb ed="#S" n="39"/>were neverthelesse and are agreea 
          <lb ed="#S" n="40"/>ble with us, neyther hath the discorde  
          <lb ed="#S" n="41"/>about fasting, broake our concorde in  
          <lb ed="#S" n="42"/>faith. Thus much Irenaeus. Moreo

          <lb ed="#S" n="47"/>reigne of Theodosius the younger, the  
          <lb ed="#S" n="48"/>same diversitie was in the Church,  
          <lb ed="#S" n="49"/>and setteth it downe in these wordes  
          <lb ed="#S" n="50"/>following: Furthermore they have  
          <lb ed="#S" n="51"/>not the same kinde of abstinence from  
          <lb ed="#S" n="52"/>meate: For some doe altogether ab 
          <lb ed="#S" n="53"/>steine from living creatures: some a 
          <lb ed="#S" n="54"/>mong living creatures doe eate fishe  
          <lb ed="#S" n="55"/>onely: some with fish doe feede on  
          <lb ed="#S" n="56"/>soules also, saying, that they (as Moses  
          <lb ed="#S" n="57"/>saith) have their substaunce of water:  
          <lb ed="#S" n="58"/>Some are knowne to absteine from  
          <lb ed="#S" n="59"/>Hearbes and egges: some doe feede of  
          <lb ed="#S" n="60"/>drie breade onely: some not so much  
          <lb ed="#S" n="61"/>as that: some fasting nine houres, doe  
          <lb ed="#S" n="62"/>then without difference use any kinde  
          <lb ed="#S" n="63"/>of meate: and innumerable customes  
          <lb ed="#S" n="64"/>are found among sundrie men. Nowe  
          <lb ed="#S" n="65"/>the verie same Socrates shewing his  
          <lb ed="#S" n="66"/>opinion upon that diversitie doth say:  
          <lb ed="#S" n="67"/>And for because no auncient writing  
          <lb ed="#S" n="68"/>is found touching this thing, I thinke  
          <lb ed="#S" n="69"/>that the Apostles lest it free to everie  
          <lb ed="#S" n="70"/>mans judgement, taht everie one may  
          <lb ed="#S" n="71"/>worke, not by feare or necessitie, the  
          <lb ed="#S" n="72"/>thing that is good. Thus farre So 
          <lb ed="#S" n="73"/>crates. The fastes of Christians ther 
          <lb ed="#S" n="74"/>fore ought to be free and not bound to  
          <lb ed="#S" n="75"/>lawes. Apollinus, a certaine aunci 
          <lb ed="#S" n="76"/>ent and Ecclesiasticall writer dispu 
          <lb ed="#S" n="77"/>ting against Montanus the heretique  
          <lb ed="#S" n="78"/>saieth: This is hee which taught that  
          <lb ed="#S" n="79"/>marriages are undone, and which first  
          <lb ed="#S" n="80"/>of all hath appointed lawes for men to  
          <lb ed="#S" n="81"/>fast by. And verily to give about to  
          <lb ed="#S" n="82"/>set downe to all men, and nations, one  
          <lb ed="#S" n="83"/>manner of fasting in one appointed  
          <lb ed="#S" n="84"/>time, one prescribed order, and choice  
          <lb ed="#S" n="85"/>of meate is a meere follie, &amp; a braine 
          <lb ed="#S" n="86"/>sicke kinde of madnesse, For according  
          <lb ed="#S" n="87"/>to the choice of ayre, so are mens bo 
          <lb ed="#S" n="88"/>dies of sundrie temperatures, and one  
          <lb ed="#S" n="89"/>kinde of meate doth not stirre men of  
          <lb ed="#S" n="90"/>sundrie complexions, to one kinde of  
          <lb ed="#S" n="91"/>affection. The most godly way there

          <pb ed="#L" n="246"/>
          <cb ed="#L" n="a"/>
          <lb ed="#S" n="1"/>is, that all pastors in everie congrega 
          <lb ed="#S" n="2"/>tion should teach sobrietie, temperan 
          <lb ed="#S" n="3"/>cie, and the true fast in deede: not pre 
          <lb ed="#S" n="4"/>suming to prescribe any lawes for the  
          <lb ed="#S" n="5"/>choice of meates or times, but leaving  
          <lb ed="#S" n="6"/>that free to every man &amp; nation, who  
          <lb ed="#S" n="7"/>undoubtedly will have an especial eye  
          <lb ed="#S" n="8"/>to temper theselves from the thinges,  
          <lb ed="#S" n="9"/>by which they perceive ye their health  
          <lb ed="#S" n="10"/>wilbe indaungered, but most of all in  
          <lb ed="#S" n="11"/>the time when the fleshe beginneth to  
          <lb ed="#S" n="12"/>waxe over wanton, or whe some great  
          <lb ed="#S" n="13"/>peril hangeth over their head. For the  
          <lb ed="#S" n="14"/>time of fasting is not proroged till an  
          <lb ed="#S" n="15"/>appointed number of yeares or dayes  
          <lb ed="#S" n="16"/>be expired, but til the loosenes or wan 
          <lb ed="#S" n="17"/>tonnesse of the flesh, temptations, or  
          <lb ed="#S" n="18"/>motions be utterly brideled. Fastings  
          <lb ed="#S" n="19"/>being so ordered, as they be the exerci 
          <lb ed="#S" n="20"/>ses of godlines, obteine great praise in  
          <lb ed="#S" n="21"/>deede in the Church of the Lord.  
          <lb ed="#S" n="22"/>THus much hitherto touching fa 
          <lb ed="#S" n="23"/>sting. Now so that uppe this seventh  
          <lb ed="#S" n="24"/>precept, I say it forbiddeth al intem 
          <lb ed="#S" n="25"/>perauncie, it commaundeth dolinesse,  
          <lb ed="#S" n="26"/>and the cleane and lawefull use of all  
          <lb ed="#S" n="27"/>the members of the whole bodie: and  
          <lb ed="#S" n="28"/>therefore in this short precept there  
          <lb ed="#S" n="29"/>is conteined a good part of the doctrine  
          <lb ed="#S" n="30"/>of Christ and his Apostles. For Paule  
          <lb ed="#S" n="31"/>to the Thessalonians sayeth: We be 
          <lb ed="#S" n="32"/>seech you brethren, and exhort you  
          <lb ed="#S" n="33"/>by the Lorde Jesus, that yee increase  
          <lb ed="#S" n="34"/>more and more, as yee have received  
          <lb ed="#S" n="35"/>of us, howe ye ought to walke, and to

          <lb ed="#S" n="36"/>please God. For ye knowe what com 
          <lb ed="#S" n="37"/>maundementes wee gave you by the  
          <lb ed="#S" n="38"/>Lorde Jesus. For this is the will of God  
          <lb ed="#S" n="39"/>even your holinesse, that ye should ab 
          <lb ed="#S" n="40"/>steine from fornication, that everie  
          <lb ed="#S" n="41"/>one of you should knowe how to pos 
          <lb ed="#S" n="42"/>sesse his vessel in holinesse and honour,  
          <lb ed="#S" n="43"/>not in the lust of concupiscence as the

          <lb ed="#S" n="45"/>God is a revenger of all such as wee  
          <lb ed="#S" n="46"/>have forewarned you and testified.  
          <lb ed="#S" n="47"/>For God hath not called us unto un
